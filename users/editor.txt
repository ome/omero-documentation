OMERO.editor
============

OMERO.editor is an editing tool designed to facilitate recording of experimental metadata, for annotation of images in OMERO, where users can create a "template" (for example, to describe a protocol) and then use this template to create individual "experiment" files, which contain the experimental metadata. A summary of the experiment can be viewed alongside annotated images in OMERO.insight. This workflow makes it easy to reuse protocols, and to build up a detailed description of an experiment by combining several smaller protocols.

The OMERO.editor is part of the OMERO.insight client, but can also run as a stand-alone application. OMERO.editor saves files as XML documents, which makes it possible for them to be read by other software.
