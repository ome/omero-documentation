OMERO Clients
=============

OMERO ships as a server application called *OMERO.server* and a series of
clients: *OMERO.insight*, *OMERO.importer*, *OMERO.web* and *OMERO.editor*.
All run on the major operating systems and provide image visualisation,
management, and annotation to users from remote locations.
*OMERO.clients* is our collective term for our applications that allows
users access to their data in the *OMERO.server*.

Most laboratories use a number of different imaging platforms and thus
require tools to manage, visualise and analyse heterogeneous sets of
image data recorded in a range of file formats. Ideally a single set of
applications, running on a user's laptop or workstation, could access
all sets of data, and provide easy-to-use access to this data.

With over 1900 OMERO.server instances up and running worldwide, OMERO
has been shown to be relatively easy to install and get running.

We have designed and built several OMERO client applications for use
with the OMERO.server.
