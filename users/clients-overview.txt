OMERO Clients Overview
======================

Most laboratories use a number of different imaging platforms and thus
require tools to manage, visualise and analyse heterogeneous sets of
image data recorded in a range of file formats. Ideally a single set of
applications, running on a user's laptop or workstation, could access
all sets of data, and provide easy-to-use access to this data.

OMERO ships as a server application called *OMERO.server* and a series of
clients: *OMERO.web*, *OMERO.insight*, *OMERO.editor* and *OMERO.importer*.
All run on the major operating systems and provide image visualisation,
management, and annotation to users from remote locations. With a large  number of OMERO.server installations worldwide, OMERO has been shown to be
relatively easy to install and get running.

*OMERO.clients* is our collective term for our applications that allows
users access to their data in the *OMERO.server*. 

OMERO.insight (.editor, .importer) are desktop applications written in Java
and require Java 1.5 (or higher) to be installed on the user's computer
(automatically installed on most up-to-date OS X and Windows XP systems).

OMERO.web [1]_
--------------

OMERO.web is a web-based client for users who wish to access their data in the
browser. This offers a similar view to the OMERO.insight desktop client.
Developers can use the |OmeroWeb| to build customised views.

OMERO.insight [2]_
------------------

OMERO.insight provides a number of tools for accessing and using data in an
OMERO Server. To find out more, see the
:doc:`client-tutorials/insight/insight-getting-started` section.

Among many features, the noteworthy OMERO.insight elements are:

- DataManager, a traditional tree-based view of the data hierarchies in an
  OMERO Server. DataManager supports access to all image metadata,
  annotations, tags.
- ImageViewer, for visualisation of 5D images (space, channel, time). The
  ImageViewer makes use of the OMERO Server's Rendering Engine, and provides
  high-performance viewing of multi-dimensional images on standard
  workstations (e.g. scrolling through space and time), without requiring
  installation of high-powered graphics cards. Most importantly, image viewing
  at remote locations is enabled. Image rendering settings are saved and
  chosen by user ID.
- Measurement Tool, a sub-application of ImageViewer that enables size and
  intensity measurements of defined regions-of-interest (ROIs).
- Working Area, for viewing, annotating, and manipulating large sets of image
  data.
- User administration.
- Image import.

OMERO.editor
------------

OMERO.editor is an editing tool designed to facilitate recording of
experimental metadata, for annotation of images in OMERO, where users can
create a "template" (for example, to describe a protocol) and then use this
template to create individual "experiment" files, which contain the
experimental metadata. A summary of the experiment can be viewed alongside
annotated images in OMERO.insight. This workflow makes it easy to reuse
protocols, and to build up a detailed description of an experiment by
combining several smaller protocols.

    OMERO.editor

The OMERO.editor is part of the OMERO.insight client, but can also run as a
stand-alone application. OMERO.editor saves files as XML documents, which
makes it possible for them to be read by other software. More information can
be found on the :doc:`client-tutorials/editor/editor` tutorial page.

OMERO.importer
--------------

The OMERO.importer is part of the OMERO.insight client, but can also run as a
stand-alone application. The OMERO.importer allows the import of proprietary
image data files from a filesystem accessed from the user's computer to a
running OMERO Server. This tool uses a standard file browser to select the
image files to an OMERO Server. For a full tutorial, please see
:doc:`client-tutorials/insight/insight-import`.

The tool uses Bio-Formats for translation of proprietary file formats in
preparation for upload to an OMERO Server. Visit :bioformats:`File Formats <>`
for a detailed list of supported formats.
