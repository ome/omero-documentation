Collaborating with data
***********************

OMERO.insight facilitates collaboration by allowing you to create groups of users and share your image data with other users in the group.

|

#. If you are a member of more than one group your default group shows in the groups menu in the toolbar above the **Projects** tab (left hand panel).

   Data in your **Projects** tab is organized according to the groups you belong to.

#. Permissions vary according to the type of the group and whether a user is a group owner, administrator or just a member. Select a group in the data tree and the permissions for it can be seen in the right hand panel.

   Administration privileges are assigned by the OMERO administrator. Users with Administration privileges can then assign ownership of groups of which they are members.

   According to your privileges and the group permissions you will be able to view and interact to different extents with data belonging to other members of a group.

   Whatever your status or the group permissions, there are no restrictions on interaction with your own data. Any permission restrictions apply only to data belonging to other users.

   In a Private group only you and the group’s owner or administrator will be able to view and interact with your data.

   In a Read-only group all other members will be able to view your data, and you theirs, but will not be able to interact with it in any other way.

   Read-annotate and Read-write groups allow much wider interaction with other user’s data.
