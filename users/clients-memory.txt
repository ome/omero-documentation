Adjusting Client Memory Requirements
====================================

By default, the OMERO clients allocate a certain amount of memory for
themselves during the start-up process which should be sufficient for most
uses. However, when dealing with very large images, you may encounter out
of memory exceptions while trying to import or display these large images. In
these situations, it is beneficial to increase the memory allocation to the
clients as outlined below.

.. note::
    Increasing the memory of your client applications depends on the operating
    system and the client used. Also note that this guide does **not** cover
    OMERO.web, which uses a different server-based configuration set-up.

OMERO.importer & OMERO.insight on OS X
--------------------------------------

- Locate the :file:`OMERO.importer.app` or :file:`OMERO.insight.app` in Finder
  and right click (or control+click) on it, choose :guilabel:`Show Package Contents` (see :ref:`memory_mac01`)
- Navigate to the :file:`Contents` folder
- Right-click on the :file:`Info.plist` file, and select to open it in either
  Xcode (if installed) or the Property List Editor (see :ref:`memory_mac02`)
- Within Xcode/Property List Editor, click and open the :guilabel:`Java` node.
  See :ref:`memory_mac03`
- Under :guilabel:`VMOptions`, you will see a line such as
  :guilabel:`-Xmx1024M`. This means you currently have 1024 Megabytes reserved
  for the application to use. Increase this to something like
  :guilabel:`-Xmx2048M`` if you wish to increase the allocated size to 2048
  Megabytes

OMERO.importer & OMERO.insight on Windows
-----------------------------------------

To alter the memory allocation of the Windows clients, you must add an
optional parameter file to the same folder as the application. For the
:file:`OMERO.insight.exe` (resp. :file:`OMERO.importer.exe`) application
this file should be named :file:`OMERO.insight.vmoptions` (resp.
:file:`OMERO.importer.vmoptions`).

.. only:: html

    The easiest way to get this file is to download
    :download:`OMERO.insight.vmoptions </downloads/OMERO.insight.vmoptions>`
    (resp. :download:`OMERO.importer.vmoptions </downloads/OMERO.importer.vmoptions>`) and copy it into the same directory as
    your :file:`OMERO.insight.exe` file (resp. :file:`OMERO.importer.exe`).

.. only:: latex

    The easiest way to get this file is to download
    :file:`OMERO.insight.vmoptions` (resp. :file:`OMERO.importer.vmoptions`)
    from the current chapter in the online version of the OMERO documentation
    and copy it into the same directory as your :file:`OMERO.insight.exe` file
    (resp. :file:`OMERO.importer.exe`). 

The default file increases the memory allocation to 2048 Megabytes, however
you may if you choose, open the file in any text editor (such as
:file:`notepad.exe`) and change the value as described in
:ref:`importer_insight_os_x`.

OMERO.importer & OMERO.insight on Unix/Linux
--------------------------------------------

Changing either the OMERO.importer or OMERO.insight memory allocation under 
Unix requires you to edit the start-up script located with the clients (either
:file:`importer-cli`, :file:`OMEROimporter_unix.sh`, or
:file:`OMEROinsight_unix.sh` file).

For OMERO.insight and OMERO.importer GUI, you will need to edit the
:file:`OMEROinsight_unix.sh` or :file:`OMEROimporter_unix.sh` file
respectively and change the ``java -Xms256000000 -Xmx1024000000 -jar
omero.insight.jar`` line with new minimum and preferred memory options (see
the `Java online documentation <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/java.html>`_ for
a full description of these options).

For the Importer CLI, the required memory requirements are listed near the top
of the :file:`importer-cli` script, and should look like this:

::

    JAVA_ARGS="-Xmx1024M"

Simply update the value to a larger number (as described in
:ref:`importer_insight_os_x`).
