    OMERO.insight

-  DataManager, a traditional tree-based view of the data hierarchies in
   an OMERO Server. DataManager supports access to all image metadata,
   annotations, tags.
-  ImageViewer, for visualisation of 5D images (space, channel, time).
   The ImageViewer makes use of the OMERO Server's Rendering Engine, and
   provides high-performance viewing of multi-dimensional images on
   standard workstations (e.g. scrolling through space and time),
   without requiring installation of high-powered graphics cards. Most
   importantly, image viewing at remote locations is enable. Image
   rendering settings are saved and chosen by user ID.
-  Measurement Tool, a sub-application of ImageViewer that enables size
   and intensity measurements of defined regions-of-interest (ROIs).
-  Working Area, for viewing, annotating, and manipulating large sets of
   image data.
-  Administrate users.
-  Import image.
