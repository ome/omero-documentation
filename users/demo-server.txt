OMERO Demo Server

Take advantage of the OMERO platform and ask for a free demo account. This 
service is hosted by the `Karlsruher Institut für Technologie <http://www.kit.edu/index.php>`_. 

To register for a free demo account, please visit `the registration page <http://qa.openmicroscopy.org.uk/registry/demo_account/>`_.

We will contact you and provide you with a server name, username and password, 
allowing you to connect to the KIT server in Germany.

Please be patient as it may take a few days to process your application after 
we receive it.

**If you have already requested a demonstration account:**

Getting started with your demo account
======================================

To log on and try the demo server you can either:

**1. Download the OMERO.insight client for your platform, install it and run it as a stand-alone application.**

You will need to have permissions allowing you to install software on your computer, and you will need to update the client if the demo server is upgraded (we will email you to inform you).

**2. Use the Java OMERO Web Start client.**

This automatically downloads the current version of the client, ensuring you are using the current version, but requires re-downloading each session. Being able to use Web Start depends on the individual security and Java set-up on your computer.

**3. Use the OMERO.web client in your regular browser.**

The web client does not allow you to import data or use the measurement tools.
