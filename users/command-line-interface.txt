Overview
--------

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |CLI| is a set of Python_ based system-administration and deployment 
tools.

Check you have Python_ installed by typing::

    $ python --version
    Python 2.5.1

Additionally, Ice_ must be installed on your machine::

    $ python -c "import Ice"

The |CLI| is currently bundled with the OMERO.server. Download the version 
corresponding to your system from the :omero_plone:`OMERO downloads <downloads>` page.

Once the server is downloaded, the |CLI| is located under the :file:`bin/` 
directory::

    $ cd OMERO.server
    $ bin/omero -h
    OMERO Python Shell. Version 4.4.5-ice33
    Type "help" for more information, "quit" or Ctrl-D to exit
    omero>

Command line help
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |CLI| is divided into several commands which may themselves contain 
subcommands. You can investigate the various commands available using the 
:option:`-h` or :option:`--help` option::

    $ bin/omero -h

Again, you can use :option:`-h` repeatedly to get more details on each of
these sub-commands::

    $ bin/omero admin -h
    $ bin/omero admin start -h

The :omerocmd:`help` command can be used to get info on other commands or 
options::

    $ bin/omero help debug       # debug is an option
    $ bin/omero help admin       # same as bin/omero admin -h

Command line workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three ways to use the command line tools:

#.  By explicitly logging in to the server first i.e. by creating a session
    using the :omerocmd:`login` command. 
    The connection parameters can be either passed directly in the connection 
    string:: 

        $ bin/omero login username@servername:4064

    or using the :option:`-s`, :option:`-u` and :option:`-p` options::
        
        $ bin/omero login -s servername -u username -p 4064
    
    If no argument can be specified, the interface will ask for the 
    connection credentials::

        $ bin/omero login
        Previously logged in to localhost:4064 as root
        Server: [localhost]
        Username: [root]
        Password:
    
    During login, a session is created locally on disk and will remain active 
    until you logout or it times out. You can then call the desired command, 
    e.g. the :command:`import` command::

        $ bin/omero import image.tiff

#.  By passing the session arguments directly to the desired command, e.g.::

        $ bin/omero -s servername -u username -p 4064 import image.tiff

#.  By calling the desired command without login arguments. You will be asked
    to login::

        $ bin/omero import image.tiff
        Server: [servername]
        Username: [username]
        Password:

Once you are done with your work, you can terminate the current session if you 
wish using the :omerocmd:`logout` command::

    $ bin/omero logout

Import images
-------------

:omerocmd:`import` is probably the first command many users will want to use.
To import a file image.tiff, use::

    $ bin/omero import image.tiff

Many options can be passed to the :command:`import`. They can be listed using 
the :option:`-h` option::

    $ bin/omero import -h

Manage sessions
---------------

The :omerocmd:`sessions` commands manage user sessions stored locally on disk. 
Several sessions can be active simultaneously, but only one will be used for a 
single invocation of `bin/omero`::

    $ bin/omero sessions -h

Multiple sessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stored sessions can be listed using the :omerocmd:`sessions list` command::

    $ bin/omero sessions list
     Server    | User | Group           | Session                              | Active    | Started
    -----------+------+-----------------+--------------------------------------+-----------+--------------------------
     localhost | test | read-annotate-2 | 22fccb8b-d04c-49ec-9d52-116a163728ca | Logged in | Fri Nov 23 14:55:25 2012
     localhost | root | system          | 1f800a16-1dc2-407a-8a85-fb44005306be | True      | Fri Nov 23 14:55:18 2012
    (2 rows)

Sessions keys can then be reused to switch between stored sessions::

    $ bin/omero sessions login -k 22fccb8b-d04c-49ec-9d52-116a163728ca
    Server: [localhost]
    Joined session 1f800a16-1dc2-407a-8a85-fb44005306be (root@localhost:4064).
    $ bin/omero sessions list
     Server    | User | Group           | Session                              | Active    | Started
    -----------+------+-----------------+--------------------------------------+-----------+--------------------------
     localhost | test | read-annotate-2 | 22fccb8b-d04c-49ec-9d52-116a163728ca | True      | Fri Nov 23 14:55:25 2012
     localhost | root | system          | 1f800a16-1dc2-407a-8a85-fb44005306be | Logged in | Fri Nov 23 14:55:18 2012
    (2 rows)

Sessions directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default sessions are saved locally on disk under :file:`~/omero/sessions`. 
The location of the current session file can be retrieved using the 
:omerocmd:`sessions file` command::

    $ bin/omero sessions file
    /Users/ome/omero/sessions/localhost/root/aec828e1-79bf-41f3-91e6-a4ac76ff1cd5

If you want to use a custom session directory, use the 
:option:`--session-dir` argument in the :command:`sessions` commands::

    $ bin/omero login --session-dir=/tmp
    $ bin/omero sessions list --session-dir=/tmp
    $ bin/omero logout --session-dir=/tmp
