OMERO.importer
==============

The OMERO.importer is part of the OMERO.insight client, but can also run as a stand-alone application. The OMERO.importer
allows the import of proprietary image data files from a filesystem accessed from
the user's computer to a running OMERO Server. This tool uses a
standard file browser to select the image files to an OMERO Server.
The tool uses Bio-Formats for translation of proprietary file
formats in preparation for upload to an OMERO Server. Visit `File Formats
<http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats>`_ for a detailed list of supported formats.
