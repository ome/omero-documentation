Managing Data

e.g.  ``Monday Acquisition`` is created in the OMERO server, and
displayed in the Inspector.

To add a new Dataset to the Project ``Monday Acquisition``:

   -  Right-click on the selected Project. Then select New Dataset... from
      the pop-up menu.
   -  Or click on the |filenew| icon.

-  The ``Create`` dialog will pop up.
-  Once created, the new Dataset will appear under the selected Project.

Manage

Using the Inspector, the user can

-  Cut (i.e. unlink) Datasets (resp. Images) from a Project (resp.
   Dataset).
-  Copy or Paste Datasets (resp. Images) to a Project (resp. Dataset).
   This is NOT a deep copy i.e. a link between the Dataset (resp. Image)
   and the Project (resp. Dataset) is created. We view the possibility
   as a feature. The user can add the same Dataset (resp. Image) to
   several Projects (resp. Datasets) and only have one Dataset (resp.
   Image) to handle.
-  Delete Project, Dataset, Image, etc.

The same options are available for Plate, Screen, Tag Set and Tag.

Working Area
------------

The Working area is built and displayed when browsing data e.g. a Plate

.. figure:: /images/insight-data-manager-5toolbar.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Working area

-  Browsing a Project (resp. Dataset, Plate):

   -  Select the Project (resp. Dataset, Plate) in the Inspector.
   -  Click on the icon.

-  Expanding a Dataset, a Tag or a time interval.

Managing Image Attachments

Attachments can be downloaded, viewed, and deleted by clicking the
double arrow beside each one. Note that unlinking an attachment from an
image will remove the link between the two, but will NOT delete the
attachment from the server.

The Preview tab on the Right-hand panel provides a mini preview window
of your image and allows you to tune some of the rendering settings
without having to launch the full image viewer.
