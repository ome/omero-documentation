   :alt: Cut, copy, paste and delete

Using the Inspector, the user can

-  Cut (i.e. unlink) Datasets (resp. Images) from a Project (resp.
   Dataset).
-  Copy or Paste Datasets (resp. Images) to a Project (resp. Dataset).
   This is NOT a deep copy i.e. a link between the Dataset (resp. Image)
   and the Project (resp. Dataset) is created. We view the possibility
   as a feature. The user can add the same Dataset (resp. Image) to
   several Projects (resp. Datasets) and only have one Dataset (resp.
   Image) to handle.
-  Delete Project, Dataset, Image, etc.

The same options are available for Plate, Screen, Tag Set and Tag.

Working area
------------

The Working area is built and displayed when browsing data e.g. a Plate

.. figure:: /images/insight-data-manager-5toolbar.png
   :align: center

   :alt: Working area

-  Browsing a Project (resp. Dataset, Plate):

   -  Select the Project (resp. Dataset, Plate) in the Inspector.
   -  Click on the icon.

-  Expanding a Dataset, a Tag or a time interval.

Attachments can be downloaded, viewed, and deleted by clicking the

image will remove the link between the two, but will NOT delete the
attachment from the server.
