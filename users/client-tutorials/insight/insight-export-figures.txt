Exporting Figures
=================

Since OMERO 4.2, OMERO.insight offers the ability to export images as figures,
based on their annotations, metadata, ROIs etc. All figures are saved as
attachments to the appropriate Project, Dataset or Image, and are also
available to download. A figure legend is generated for each figure
(downloaded as text file) which contains additional details for each
image, such as name, ID, scale bar size, rendering settings, projected
planes, pixel size, etc. These figures are based on examples detailed
below.

See the demo movie here.

All figure generating options are available from the top-right toolbar
in Insight and will try to use the currently selected images or datasets
in the chosen figure (see screen-shot).

Thumbnail Figure
----------------

This creates a figure of thumbnails, either using the currently selected
images or all the images within a dataset. The date range of the images
is displayed on the figure, and it is also possible to choose a list of
tags to sort the images by. If an image is tagged by multiple tags, it
will appear more than once in the figure.

    Four datasets.

    :align: center
    :width: 50%
    :alt: Two datasets, with thumbnails sorted by 4 tags

    Two datasets, with thumbnails sorted by 4 tags.

Split-view Figure
-----------------

Choose one or more images to be arranged in a split-view with one image
per row. When making the image you can decide which channels should be
shown as split panes and which are in the merged image. You can also
choose names for each channel (or use existing names) and choose whether
you want the split channels to be coloured or greyscale. Images can be
labeled with their name, the name of their dataset(s) or associated
tags.

.. figure:: /images/insight-export-splitview-figure.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :alt: Split-View Figure of 3 images with 4 channels

    Split-View Figure of 3 images with 4 channels, showing 2 channels
    in the merged panel. Images are labeled with their Tags.

Movie Figure
------------

This figure displays selected frames from one or more movies, laid out
on a single row. If timing metadata is available, the time of each frame
is displayed. Images can be labeled with their name, the name of their
dataset(s) or associated tags.

.. figure:: /images/insight-export-movie-figure.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :alt: Movie figure showing three images, labeled with image name

    Movie figure showing three images, labeled with image name. The
    third movie does not have timing metadata (frame numbers shown
    instead), and has fewer frames than the top 2 movies.

ROI Figure
----------

If a rectangle ROI has previously been defined for an image (or images),
then this figure will display the ROI as a larger panel to the right of
the main image, zoomed by a chosen factor. The zoomed ROI will be split
into selected channels, as for the split-view figure. Images can be
labeled with their name, the name of their dataset(s) or associated
tags.

.. figure:: /images/insight-export-split-roi-figure.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :alt: ROI figure with split view

    ROI figure with split view showing a ROI zoom of 4.0 from the
    original pixels. 

.. note::
    In this figure, the rendering settings are the
    same for all 3 images (as noted in the figure legend), allowing a
    direct comparison between them.

ROI Movie Figure
----------------

For movies that have an ROI, this script will display the ROI region for
every time point that the ROI exists. If the ROI for a particular time
point spans several Z-sections, these will be projected.

.. figure:: /images/insight-export-roi-movie-figure.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :alt: ROI figure from 2 movies

    ROI figure from 2 movies. The number of frames is determined by the
    ROI for each image and images are labeled on the left with their
    Tags.

Reference Example Figures (from outside sources)
------------------------------------------------

This is a list of the types of figures that are common in the Cell
Biology literature (JCB archive), serving as a basis for scripts that
could construct and export these figures from OMERO.

All Figures should also export as text file (or save as annotation
description) a figure legend that describes how the figure was made:

-  Names and IDs and descriptions of images, tags, datasets etc used
-  All parameters that the user enters (unless shown on figure itself)

In general:

-  For multiple Z-plane images, use Maximum intensity projection and
   allow user to choose Z-range (or single plane).
-  When adding labels, best to use black text outside of the image
   instead of white text on the image itself, as this allows users to
   edit in Photoshop. Some exceptions where this isn't possible.

The following examples have been gathered from various sources to
illustrate what the various figures should look like.

Split-view figure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  takes a number of images and makes each into a split-view on separate
   rows.
-  Merged image based on current rendering settings
-  Options to exclude channels from figure
-  Colour split channels or use greyscale
