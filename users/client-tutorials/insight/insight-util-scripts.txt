Running Utility Scripts
=======================

Instructions for running 'Util Scripts' from OMERO.insight through the
scripting service, as released with OMERO 4.2.

Batch Image Export
------------------

<movies/omero-4-3/mov/BatchImageExport-4.3.mov>`

The Batch Image Export script saves multiple planes of selected images
in a zip folder for download. These can be used for creating your own
figures. By default, the script exports a png file for each individual
channels and a 'merged' view of selected images. The rendering settings
used are the currently saved rendering settings in OMERO. For example, if you
want all the images to have the same rendering settings, then these
should be applied and saved before running the script.

It is also possible to export an entire Z or T series or range (e.g. to
make a time-course figure) for each image.

**OME-TIFF export and projection**
From the 4.3.2 release, this script also supports export of images as
OME-TIFFs. If this format is chosen, the entire image is exported as a
single file, including all planes. Any Z or T selections are ignored.
Maximum Intensity Projection of images is also supported since 4.3.2. Users
should be aware that both these options have the potential to make
heavier processing demands on the server. If admins wish to turn off
these options, they can comment out the appropriate options in the
script: `rstring('OME-TIFF')` and/or `rstring('Max projection')`.

Channel Offsets
---------------

<movies/omero-4-3/mov/ChannelOffsets-4.3.mov>`

The Channel Offsets script allows you to apply X, Y and Z offsets to
individual channels in an image, creating a new image in the process.
You can pick which of the channels from the source image to combine in
the new image (up to the first 4 channels). The script can process
several images at once, placing the new images in the same Dataset as
the source images by default, or in a new Dataset if the "New Dataset
Name" parameter is filled out.

Dataset to Plate
----------------

:snapshot:`MOVIE: Dataset to Plate demo
<movies/omero-4-3/mov/Dataset_To_Plate-4.3.2.mov>`

This script allows you to create a "Plate" from an ordered set of images
in a Dataset, assigning images to a row and column based on their
sequence by name. You can arrange images by row or column, choose the
size of the row or column and how they are named.

This script takes a number of single-plane images or image Z-stacks,
identified either by `Image_ID` or by the ID of the Dataset that contains
them. All input images should have the same X, Y and Z dimensions and
are expected to have a single channel & time-point. If you want to use a
subset of the images, choose the "Filter Names" option by entering some
text. Only image names that contain this text will be used.

There are 2 alternative methods you can use to define which images are
assigned to which Z, T or C index in the new image and how big the new
dimensions are (see below).

Optionally you can specify colours and names for the channels in the new
image.

Auto Define Dimensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option is chosen by default. This method uses the names of each
image to try and identify the Z, T or C index. The user should choose
the naming pattern for each dimension. For example, if you want to
combine images named like these:

-  ``image001_C01_Z01.tiff``
-  ``image001_C01_Z02.tiff``

you should choose: \* Channel Name Pattern: "\_C" \* Z Name Pattern:
"\_Z" \* Time Name Pattern: "None" (optional)

If the input images are Z stacks, then the 'Z Name Pattern' will be
ignored and the Z-size of the first image will be used instead.

.. note:: It is assumed that all images have the same Z size.

Manually Define Dimensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With this option, the images are combined in the same order that they
appear when sorted alphabetically (default in OMERO.insight). If you want to
stitch the planes in a single dimension (e.g. time) then you only need
to choose "Time" as the Dimension 1 value and this will do the job.

If you want to stitch the planes across 2 or more dimensions, you need
to specify the dimensions in the order that they change in the list of
input images. For example, images named like this:

-  ``image001_C01_Z01.tiff``
-  ``image001_C01_Z02.tiff``
-  ``image001_C01_Z03.tiff``
-  ``image001_C01-Z04.tiff``
-  ``image001_C01-Z05.tiff``
-  ``image001_C02-Z01.tiff``
-  ``image001_C02-Z02.tiff``
-  ``image001_C02-Z03.tiff``
-  ``image001_C02-Z04.tiff``
-  ``image001_C02-Z05.tiff``

The first dimension to change is Z (changes between images 1,2,3,4,5 in
the list) and the second dimension to change is Channel (changes between
images 5 and 6).

You must specify the Dimensions that these images represent in the
combined image, in the order that they change in the sorted list. In the
above example, Dimension\_1 would be "Z", since this changes first, and
Dimension\_2 is "Channel". It is also necessary to specify the Size of
the dimensions. In this case, "size Z" is 5 and "size C" is 2. (It is
possible to omit the size of the last dimension since this can be
calculated by the script).

If the input images are Z stacks, you do not need to specify a Z
dimension (it will be ignored if you do).
