OMERO.editor
============

Introduction
------------

OMERO.editor is a Java tool that requires `Java 1.5 <http://java.com/en/download/>`_
and can operate as a stand-alone application or as part of the
OMERO.insight client. In both cases, it saves metadata as XML files that
can be used to annotate images, datasets, etc, in OMERO. If used as part
of OMERO.insight, the files can be saved to an OMERO server.

A :snapshot:`demo movie <omero/editor/movies/OMERO.editor-Beta4.mov>` of the OMERO.editor
illustrates some of its functionalities.

The OMERO.editor has been designed to achieve two key functions:

-  Facilitate the digital recording of experimental metadata.

-  Enable important parameters to be distinguished from the main text,
   e.g. to summarise the experiment in a concise form.

Start OMERO.editor from OMERO.insight
-------------------------------------

You can start the editor tool by clicking the following
icon |Editor Icon| in the toolbar. You can then open any editor file 
by double-clicking it, either when you find it attached to a Project, 
Dataset or Image, or
by browsing under :menuselection:`View --> Attachments` (see screen shot).

UI Layout
---------

The OMERO.editor displays a single file per window, which will typically
be split into 3 panels.

The left of the UI displays a hierarchical outline of the file that can
be used for navigating large files. The center is the main display of
the file for editing experimental variables and the right panel is for
editing the protocol 'template'.

The workspace of the editor displays the complete protocol in the
largest central panel. To the left, an outline of the protocol can be
used for navigation and the panel on the right of the window is used for
display and editing of parameter details. In order to make protocols appear
more familiar to users, the central panel can be used
to view the protocol in a 'Text View' or in a 'Tree View', see below.
You can switch between the two views by using the tabs at the top of the page.

The **Text View** displays the title, description and parameters in a page layout.

Protocols can also be  viewed in the **Tree View**.

Multiple 'parameters' per step
------------------------------

In order to record a single step of a protocol that has multiple
variables, e.g. "Incubate cells with {Antibody} at a dilution of {1:500}
for {60 minutes}", OMERO.editor supports multiple parameters per
step (see screenshots below). Placing parameters in context with
descriptions also allows a more natural way of combining multiple
parameters and removes the need to give every parameter a description.

In both cases, parameters can be seen in the context of the step description, 
which can be edited in the page layout of  the Text view

or the right panel of the Tree view.

Parameters can be edited in the right panel of both views.

Table of parameter values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For some steps in a protocol, the parameters can have more than one
value. In the above example, several antibodies may be used for staining
different targets, and each one will have a different concentration and
staining time. OMERO.editor supports the documenting of this data by
allowing the values for each parameter to be displayed in a table (add
table with the |Add Table Button| icon in the Tree view). Each parameter
is represented by a column, with the column name displaying the name of
each parameter. 'Drop-down' and 'Check-box' parameters are represented
with the appropriate controls in the table (see below).
