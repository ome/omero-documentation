What is the copyright information for OME material?
---------------------------------------------------

As OME is a consortium of separate groups, from different institutions,
working together on a common product you will find different copyright
messages across our code, documentation, products and publications.
These messages reflect the origin of that particular part of our
material.

    *Note: the origin is just that, it does not indicate that people
    from that institution are responsible for that code now. i.e. If a
    file is created by Glencoe, but worked on extensively by team
    members from Dundee, its copyright will **not** change.*

Agreements exist between the different entities in the consortium to
release the material together under a unified license.
