~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  NOTE: This scenario is reflecting the usability/development work
   being conducted under `#3476 </ome/ticket/3476>`_ Web UI review.

The scenario shall be updated and used for testing the consistency work
that has taken place for a release.

-  For this test, go through the various components in insight and
   compare them to their web counterparts. Look for any glaring
   inconsistencies.

**[Backdated scenario for 4.3.0]**

The focus of the work for the 4.3 release has taken place in the right
hand and left hand panel for the web. This is where the focus for
checking for consistency should lie.

-  Rate an Image in Insight and check the rating functionality is shown
   in the web client. Note this is only a read-only action in the web
   and cannot be changed.
-  Check the consistency of several images for the layout of the channel
   labeling.
-  Annotation Display in Web
-  Check the values of lot number, serial number for Detector,
   Objective, Light-Source are displayed for an image in Insight and
   then are the same image in the web.
-  Show and hide the unset fields in the channel settings.
-  Check the contained in dataset for an image in Insight and then check
   for the same image in the web that it is the same.
