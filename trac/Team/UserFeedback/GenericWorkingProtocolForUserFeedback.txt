The following outlines the working protocol for user feedback. [*Ongoing
work - Under review*\ ]

The user feedback on a given area **MUST** begin as early possible at
the start of the new development cycle it is at that initial phase where
the following can be asked:

-  Who are the main set of users?
-  What is the main objective?
-  What is our own vision/the users vision of the objective?

The key requirement from a usability perspective at the initial phase is
sufficient leads to follow up in order to begin the user research. And
also sufficient lead time ahead of the development process

-  User investigation

(TODO:)

-  Prototype phases

The level of prototyping can take the various forms.

-  1) The upfront prototype work pre any development work.
-  2) Prototype after development work.

1) The upfront prototype work pre-development work is for the purpose to
guide and brainstorm ideas for the work.

    The user investigation is the primary source of information for
    this, providing a review of the possible range of existing software
    applications where relevant and general feedback/comments from the
    user contacts made.

2) The central purpose of a software prototype after development is to
gain the initial reaction to the feature/workflow that has been put into
place. The work takes place done within an single iteration, depending
on any potential limitations to user access.

Personal Note: This may need to evolve further some additional issues to
consider
