    **Prerequisites: Make sure User1 and User2 are a member of group
    'Private' and Owner is owner of the group**

-  Import data as User1 in group 'Private':

   -  create Project1/Dataset1 and import there Image1 and Image2
   -  Log in as User2. You should have no access to User1's data
   -  Log in as Owner. You should be able to access User1's data

-  Make sure User1 and User2 are a member of group 'Collaborative
   read-only'
-  Import data as User1 in group 'Collaborative read-only':

   -  create Project2/Dataset2 and import there Image3 and Image4
   -  Log in as User2, browse and manage User1 data. You should only be
      able to view data, no editing, annotating, attaching.

-  Make sure User1 and User2 are a member of group 'Collaborative'
-  Import data as User1 in group 'Collaborative':

   -  create Project3/Dataset3 and import there Image5 and Image6
   -  Log in as User2, browse and manage User1 data. What you can do is
      listed :omero_plone:`here <server/permissions>`

      -  comment Image5
      -  tag Image5 by 'permission tag'

-  All the above steps are now required to be repeated from within the
   client-importer.

   -  This is testing the same permission groups of private
      Collaborative read only, and Collaborative but importing the data
      from within the insight client-importer,
