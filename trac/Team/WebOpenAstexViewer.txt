34. Web: Open Astex Viewer
--------------------------

**Implemented for 4.3.2 release**

-  Choose a map from from
   `Â http://emdatabank.org/recententries.html <http://emdatabank.org/recententries.html>`_

   -  Click on 'PDBe' for an entry that looks cool!
   -  Best to have a reasonably big map - over 120x120x120. See 'Map
      Information'
   -  Go to Downloads and grab the map.gz, unzip and import! (Maybe grab
      a couple while you're there?)

-  View the image in web: you should see an option for 'Volume Viewer'
   in the web metadata pane for that image
-  Open the Volume viewer. You should get Java Applet with volume
   displayed.
-  Zoom, rotate, pan.
-  Various controls

   -  Wire-frame vv solid
   -  Adjust contour level. You should see "something" for all but the
      extreme ranges.
   -  Try loading a larger map (not scaled down). This option won't
      appear if the original is below 120
   -  Try loading 'raw' data (float). This option won't appear if it's
      not a float pixel type (most are)
   -  NB - for large or complex images this step may fail.
   -  Adjust the contours again to check they are working with float
      values.
