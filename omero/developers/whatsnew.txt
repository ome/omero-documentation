What's new for OMERO 5.2 for developers
=======================================

- The :doc:`/sysadmins/version-requirements` section provides extensive
  details about which operating systems and dependency versions we intend to
  support for the life of 5.2 and the likely changes to these for the next
  major release (currently planned to be 5.3). Most notably for development
  purposes, we have dropped support for Java 1.6.


Breaking changes
----------------

OMERO.web
^^^^^^^^^

OMERO.web has undergone a major upgrade, updating jsTree to version 3 and
using json for all tree loading to substantially improve performance.

See the :pythondoc:`OMERO.web python docs <omeroweb/omeroweb.html>` for more
information.

Graphs
^^^^^^

The API's request operations :javadoc:`Chmod
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chmod.html>`, :javadoc:`Chgrp
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chgrp.html>`, :javadoc:`Chown
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chown.html>`, :javadoc:`Delete
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Delete.html>`, and their superclass
:javadoc:`GraphModify <slice2html/omero/cmd/GraphModify.html>`, were
deprecated in 5.1 and will be removed in 5.3. They are replaced by
:javadoc:`Chmod2
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chmod2.html>`:javadoc:`Chgrp2
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chgrp2.html>`, :javadoc:`Chown2
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chown2.html>`, :javadoc:`Delete2
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Delete2.html>`, and their superclass
:javadoc:`GraphModify2 <slice2html/omero/cmd/GraphModify2.html>`.
OMERO developers who have not migrated yet should refer to
:doc:`Server/GraphsMigration` and take action before the deprecated features
are removed.

Java Gateway
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Java gateway has undergone a major overhaul. 
This should make the development of Java applications much easier.
We do not intend to modify the methods already available but this work should
still be considered as under development. Feedback as always welcome.
See :doc:`/developers/Java` for more information or follow the example in
`minimal-omero-client <https://github.com/ome/minimal-omero-client>`_.

OMERO model
^^^^^^^^^^^

The :literal:`Rect` class has been renamed to :literal:`Rectangle` to match
the OME-XML schema. This requires the corresponding change to be made in
client software that uses the OMERO.blitz server API to work with ROIs.
