What's new for OMERO 5.2 for developers
=======================================

- The :doc:`/sysadmins/version-requirements` section provides extensive
  details about which operating systems and dependency versions we intend to
  support for the life of 5.2 and the likely changes to these for the next
  major release (currently planned to be 5.3). Most notably for development
  purposes, we have dropped support for Java 1.6.

The Java gateway has undergone a major overhaul [details to follow]

Breaking changes

OMERO.web

OMERO.web has undergone a major upgrade, updating jsTree to version 3 and
using json for all tree loading to substantially improve performance.

deprecated in 5.1 and will be removed in 5.3. They are replaced by

OMERO developers who have not migrated yet should refer to
:doc:`Server/GraphsMigration` and take action before the deprecated features
are removed.
