What's new for OMERO 5.1 for developers
=======================================

- The :doc:`/sysadmins/version-requirements` section provides extensive
  details about which operating systems and dependency versions we will be
  supporting for the life of 5.1 and the likely changes to these for the next
  major release (currently planned to be 5.2). Most notably for development
  purposes, we are deprecating support for Java 1.6 and Python 2.6.
- :doc:`Model/Units` introduces the new Units-types which are available
  for use from :doc:`Model Objects <Model/EveryObject>` (note that this
  documentation has been expanded since the release of 5.1.2 and is still a
  work in progress).
- Similarly, :doc:`Model/KeyValuePairs` introduces the new concept of a
  "map" type, which consists of ordered lists of key-value pairs.
- :doc:`Server/ObjectGraphs` explains how the new graph operations of
  :javadoc:`omero::cmd <slice2html/omero/cmd.html>` are implemented.
- Deprecated methods in IContainer and RenderingEngine have been removed, as
  have the deprecated services IDelete and Gateway.
- Pojos methods have been deprecated and replaced by corresponding units
  methods.
- OMERO 5.1 requires a Unicode-encoded (UTF8) database.
- Since OMERO 5.1.3, the Bio-Formats submodule has been removed from the source
  code and Bio-Formats is managed as another dependency using Ivy. See
  :doc:`build-system` for more details.

Breaking changes
----------------

OMERO.web
^^^^^^^^^

There have been many updates to this client for 5.1. See the
:ref:`web-breaking-changes` section on the :doc:`/sysadmins/whatsnew` page for
further details.

OMERO.web template and view writers need to use the ``@render_response()``
decorator, see :ref:`render-response` for more details.

Graphs
^^^^^^

The API's request operations :javadoc:`Chgrp
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chgrp.html>`, :javadoc:`Chown
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chown.html>`, :javadoc:`Delete
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Delete.html>`, and their superclass
:javadoc:`GraphModify <slice2html/omero/cmd/GraphModify.html>`, are now
deprecated. They are replaced by :javadoc:`Chgrp2
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chgrp2.html>`, :javadoc:`Chown2
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chown2.html>`, :javadoc:`Delete2
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Delete2.html>`, and their superclass
:javadoc:`GraphModify2 <slice2html/omero/cmd/GraphModify2.html>`. To
allow each deprecated request to be implemented by its corresponding
replacement, a partial API compatibility layer is included in OMERO 5.1
and is activated by default through the new configuration property
:property:`omero.graphs.wrap`. If the new request implementations
introduce regressions, setting that property to ``false`` will
reactivate the implementations from OMERO 5.0. However, the
configuration property :property:`omero.graphs.wrap` will be *removed*
in OMERO 5.2 and :javadoc:`Chgrp <slice2html/omero/cmd/Chgrp.html>`,
:javadoc:`Chown <slice2html/omero/cmd/Chown.html>`, :javadoc:`Delete
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Delete.html>`, and :javadoc:`GraphModify
<slice2html/omero/cmd/GraphModify.html>`, will be *removed* in OMERO
5.3. OMERO 5.1 users should thus be :doc:`using the new 5.1 graph
requests <Server/GraphsMigration>` so that problems may be detected and
corrected before the deprecated features are removed.

Tables
^^^^^^

OMERO.tables attribute names beginning with `__` are reserved for internal
use, see :doc:`Tables`.

ImportContainer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes to ImportContainer will break any listeners implemented by external
developers.

Units
^^^^^

A number of Objects formerly of numerical type are now unit quantities. As a
result, code working with these types will no longer compile and queries of
these types will now return different values. For example, as explained in
:ref:`querying-units`, to return the floating point number using::

   select planeInfo.exposureTime from PlaneInfo planeInfo ...

you now need to add ``.value`` as follows::

   select planeInfo.exposureTime.value from PlaneInfo planeInfo ...

and you also need the enum to go along with it.
