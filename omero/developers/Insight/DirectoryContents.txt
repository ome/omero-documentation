Directory contents
==================

The repository of the software artifacts is organised as follows:

-  ``build``: This directory contains the tools to compile, run, test,
   and deliver the application.

-  ``config``: Various configuration files required by the application
   to run.

-  ``docgen``: Documentation artifacts that are used to build actual
   documents. These are organized in two sub-directories: javadoc and
   xdocs. The former only contains resources (like CSS files) to
   generate programmer's documentation -- the actual documentation
   contents are obtained from the source code. The latter contains both
   resources (like stylesheets and DHTML code) to generate all other
   kinds of documentation (like design and users documents) and the
   actual documentation contents in the form of XML/HTML files.

-  ``launch``: Launcher scripts and installation instructions bundled
   with the default application distribution file. Its sub-dirs contain
   further resources to build platform-specific distributions.

-  ``legal``: Terms and conditions under which the various artifacts in
   this repository are released. A README file specifies which license
   applies to which artifact.

-  ``LIB``: All library files required by the application. Its test
   sub-dir contains additional libraries required by the test code.

-  ``SRC``: Contains the application source files.

-  ``TEST``: The test code.

-  ``CodeTemplate``: This file describes the coding style that all
   source files must conform to.

-  ``README``: The README file.
