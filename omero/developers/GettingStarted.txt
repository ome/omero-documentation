Working with OMERO
==================

This page describes various tools and resources useful for working with
the OMERO API, as well as some tips on setting up your working
environment. It should be useful to client developers working in any of
the supported languages. For language specific info, see the following
links: |OmeroJava|, |OmeroPy|, |OmeroCpp|, |OmeroMatlab|.

OMERO.clients
-------------

The OMERO model is implemented as a relational PostgreSQL database on
the OMERO.server and mapped to code-generated model objects used by the
clients in the various supported languages (linked above). The 
OMERO API consists of a number of services for working with these objects and
associated binary data. Typically, clients will use various stateless
services to query the OMERO model and then use the stateful services for
exchange of binary data or image rendering.

A typical client interaction might have an outline such as:

-  Log in to OMERO, obtaining connection and 'service factory'
-  Use the stateless 'Query Service' or 'Container Service' to traverse
   Projects, Datasets and Images
-  Use the stateful 'Rendering Engine' or 'Thumbnail Service' to view
   images
-  Use the stateful 'Raw Pixels Service' or 'Raw File Store' to retrieve
   pixel or file data for analysis
-  Create new Annotations or other objects and save them with the
   stateless 'Update Service'
-  Close stateful services to free resources and close the connection

OMERO.clients use a common 'gateway' to communicate with an OMERO.server
installation and allow the user to import, display, edit, and manage
server data. The OMERO team has developed a suite of clients 
(see :doc:`/users/clients-overview`), but the
open source nature of the OMERO project also allows developers to create
their own, customized clients. If you are interested in doing this, further
information is available on |DevelopingOmeroClients|.

OMERO server
------------

Although most interactions with OMERO can be achieved remotely, you will
generally find it easier to have the server installed on your
development machine, particularly if you are going to be doing a lot of
OMERO development. This gives you local access to the database, binary
repository, logs etc. and means you can work 'off-line'.

Even if the server you are connecting to is remote, you will still want
to have the server package available locally, so as to give you the
command line tools, Python libraries, etc. It is important that all
OMERO server and client libraries you use are the same OMERO version.

You may wish to work with the most recent OMERO release, or
alternatively you can use the latest development code. Instructions on
how to download or check out the code can be found on the main
:omero_plone:`downloads page <downloads>`.

Regular builds of the server are performed by Jenkins_ (formerly known as 
hudson) and all results are available here :omerojob:`here <>`, 
including generated :javadoc:`javadocs <>`.

Environment variables
---------------------

In addition to the install instructions, you might find it useful to set
the following variables:

-  OMERO\_HOME: should be set to the directory containing the OMERO
   distribution or build

   ::

       # E.g. If you built the server yourself
       export OMERO_PREFIX=~/Desktop/OMERO/dist
       # Or you downloaded a release package
       export OMERO_PREFIX=~/Desktop/OMERO.server-Beta-4.2.2

-  Add the /bin/ directory to your PATH - allows you to call the 'omero'
   command from anywhere

   ::

       export PATH=$PATH:$OMERO_PREFIX/bin/

-  For Python developers, set your PYTHONPATH as follows

   ::

       export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$OMERO_PREFIX/lib/python/

Now checkout the |CLI|.

::

    $ omero -h

Database access
---------------

It is useful to be able to directly query or browse the OMERO PostgreSQL
database, which can be achieved with a number of tools. E.g.

-  psql - This command line tool should already be installed.
   Depending on your permissions, you may need to connect as the
   'postgres' user:

   ::

       $ sudo -u postgres psql omero
       Password:       # sudo password
       omero=# \d;     # give a complete list of tables and views
       omero=# \d annotation;         # list all the columns in a particular table
       omero=# select id, discriminator, ns, textValue, file from annotation order by id desc;   # query

   tool for working with PostgreSQL

OMERO model

   :alt:

You can browse the OMERO model in a number of ways, one of which is by
looking at the database itself (see above). Another is via the on-line
:javadoc:` OMERO model <slice2html/omero/model.html>` docs.

However, due to the complexity of the OMERO model, it is helpful to have
some starting points (follow links below to the docs themselves).

.. note::

    Figures to the right show highly simplified outline of various model objects.

Projects, datasets and images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:javadoc:` Projects <slice2html/omero/model/Project.html>`
and
:javadoc:` Datasets <slice2html/omero/model/Dataset.html>`
are many-to-many containers for
:javadoc:` Images <slice2html/omero/model/Image.html>`
(linked by
:javadoc:` ProjectDatasetLinks <slice2html/omero/model/ProjectDatasetLink.html>`
and
:javadoc:` DatasetImageLinks <slice2html/omero/model/DatasetImageLink.html>`
respectively).

Projects, Datasets, Images and a number of other entities can be linked
to Annotations :javadoc:` (abstract superclass) <slice2html/omero/model/Annotation.html>`
via specific links
(:javadoc:` ProjectAnnotationLink <slice2html/omero/model/ProjectAnnotationLink.html>`,
:javadoc:` DatasetAnnotationLink <slice2html/omero/model/DatasetAnnotationLink.html>`
etc). Annotation subclasses such as
:javadoc:` CommentAnnotation <slice2html/omero/model/CommentAnnotation.html>`,
:javadoc:` FileAnnotation <slice2html/omero/model/FileAnnotation.html>`
etc. are stored in a single database table in OMERO (all Annotations have
unique ID).

Images
~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/developer-model-img.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Images in OMERO are made up many entities. These include core image components
such as :javadoc:` Pixels <slice2html/omero/model/Pixels.html>` and
:javadoc:` Channels <slice2html/omero/model/Channel.html>`, as well as a large
number of additional metadata objects such as Instrument (microscope),
Objective, Filters, Light Sources, and Detectors.
Image pixels data is stored as a single file, numbered by Pixels ID
in the OMERO repository under /OMERO/Pixels/ and can be accessed using
the Raw Pixels Store. 

.. note::

    Some features of the model are due to
    historical changes and are not exercised in practice. For example, an
    Image can have multiple sets of Pixels although only 1 is typically
    used. Also, Logical Channel and Channel can be considered a single
    entity (as they are now in the OME-model).


Working with the OMERO model objects
------------------------------------

For detailed information see |OmeroModel| and |DevelopingOmeroClients| pages.

Objects that you wish to work with on the client must be loaded from
OMERO, with the query defining the extent of any data graph that is
"fetched".

The |OmeroApi| supports 2 principle ways of
querying OMERO and retrieving the objects. You can write SQL-like
queries using the query service (uses "HQL") or you can use one of the
other services that already has suitable queries. Using the query
service is very flexible but it requires detailed knowledge of the OMERO
model (see above) and is susceptible to any change in the model.

For example, to load a specific Project and its linked Datasets you
could write a query like this:

::

    queryService = session.getQueryService()
    params = omero.sys.Parameters()
    params.map = {"pid": rlong(projectId)}
    query = "select p from Project p left outer join fetch p.datasetLinks as links left 
                outer join fetch links.child as dataset where p.id=:pid"
    project = queryService.findByQuery(query, params)
    for dataset in project.linkedDatasetList:
        print dataset.getName().getValue()

Or use the Container Service like this:

::

    containerService = session.getContainerService()
    project = containerService.loadContainerHierarchy("Project", [projectId], True)
    for dataset in project.linkedDatasetList:
        print dataset.getName().getValue()

For a list of the available services, see the |OmeroApi| page.

Examples
--------

HQL examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~

HQL is used for Query Service queries (see above). Some examples,
coupled with a knowledge of the OMERO model should get you going, along
with notes about object loading on the |OmeroModel|  page. 

.. note::
    If possible, it is advisable to use an existing API method from one 
    of the other services (as for the container service above).

Although it is possible to place query parameters directly into the string, it
is preferable (particularly for type-checking) to use the
omero.sys.Parameters object:

::

    queryService.findByQuery("from PixelsType as p where p.value='%s'" % pType, None)

    # better to do
    params = omero.sys.Parameters()
    params.map = {"pType": rstring(pType)}
    queryService.findByQuery("from PixelsType as p where p.value=:pType", params)

psql queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are a number of example psql database queries:

::

    # list any images that do not have pixels:
    omero=#select id, name from Image i where i.id not in (select image from Pixels where image is not null) order by i.id desc;

    omero=# select id, name, ome_perms(permissions) from experimentergroup;
     id  |                        name                        | ome_perms

bin/omero hql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the omero :omerocmd:`hql` command to query a remote OMERO database, entering
your login details when requested. 

.. note::

    Because you will be querying the database under a particular login, the 
    entries returned will be subject to the permissions of that login.

::

    bin/omero hql -q --limit=10 "select name from OriginalFile where id=4106"
    bin/omero hql -q --limit=10 "select id, textValue, file from Annotation a order by a.id desc"
    bin/omero hql -q --limit=10 "select id, textValue from TagAnnotation a order by a.id desc"
    bin/omero hql -q --limit=100 "select id, owner.id, started, userAgent from Session where closed is null"
