OMERO C++ language bindings
===========================

Using the :zerocdoc:`Ice C++ language mapping
<display/Ice/Hello+World+Application>` from ZeroC_, OMERO provides
native access to your data from C++ code. The ``build-cpp`` build
target produces a platform-dependent shared library which can be
linked to your application.

**Binaries are not provided**, therefore it will be necessary for you
to compile your own. Test versions are, however, built by Jenkins on a
small handful of platforms:

* :jenkins:`Windows Server 2003 (32 bit) <job/OMERO-trunk-components/component=cpp,label=x86-windows/>`
* :jenkins:`Linux <job/OMERO-trunk-components/component=cpp,label=linux/>`
* :jenkins:`MacOSX <job/OMERO-trunk-components/component=cpp,label=macosx/>`

Prerequisites
-------------

* The OMERO source code
* A C++ compiler

  * GCC is recommended for Linux and MacOS X
  * Visual Studio or the Platform SDK for Windows

* The ZeroC Ice libraries, headers and slice definitions

Restrictions
------------

Ice 3.3 and Ice 3.4 will only build with GCC versions *older* than 4.6
(they contain broken headers which newer GCC versions will not parse).
GCC 4.4 is tested and recommended.

Ice 3.5 will build with any GCC version up to 4.8, the latest stable
version; later versions may work, but are untested.

The version of GCC and/or Ice provided on your system should be
compatible, but if you are restricted to a particular version of GCC
or Ice, you may need to obtain or build a compatible version of Ice or
GCC, respectively.

Preparing to build
-------------------

Begin by following the instructions under :doc:`/developers/source_code` on
acquiring the source code. Be **sure** that the git branch you are using
matches the version of your server!

Set the :envvar:`ICE\_HOME` environment variable for your
installation.  This location varies depending upon the installation
location and Ice version in use.  Some possible locations for the
|iceversion| version of Ice follow.  Note these are just examples; you need
to adjust them for the Ice installation path and version in use.

* Ice built from source and installed into :file:`/opt`:

   .. parsed-literal::

       export ICE_HOME=/opt/Ice-|iceversion|

* Ice installed on Linux using RPM packages:

   .. parsed-literal::

       export ICE_HOME=/usr/share/Ice-|iceversion|

* MacOS with homebrew:

   .. parsed-literal::

       export ICE_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/ice/|iceversion|

* Windows using Visual Studio:

   .. parsed-literal::

       set ICE_HOME=C:\Ice-|iceversion|

Users of a package manager will also need to set :envvar:`ICE\_HOME`
if the Ice paths are not automatically detected correctly.  The
:program:`slice2xxx` tools generally don't pick up the location of the
slice definitions by default if this is unset.

.. note ::

    If the Ice headers and libraries are not present on the standard
    search paths, these will need to be specified using the
    :envvar:`CPPPATH` and :envvar:`LIBPATH` environment variables (see
    below).

Windows users building with Visual Studio will also need to run the
Visual Studio environment setup scripts:

::

    C:\Documents and Settings\USER>c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat
    Setting environment for using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 x86 tools.

or otherwise guarantee that the your environment is properly configured.
For the 64bit build, be sure to use the right setup, namely
"Start‣Microsoft Visual Studio 2008‣Visual Studio Tools‣Visual Studio
2008 Command Prompt" or "…‣Visual Studio 2008 x64 Win64 Command
Prompt".

Building the library
--------------------

To build the C++ dynamic library:

::

    cd omero
    ./build.py
    ./build.py build-cpp

or

::

    ./build.py build-all

If you would like to build the C++ tests, you can run:

::

    ./build.py test-compile-all
    ./build.py test-unit

or to test only C++:

::

    ./build.py -f components/tools/OmeroCpp/build.xml test

.. note::

    If you would like to work on just the C++ code without worrying
    about the rest of the build, you can install :program:`scons` and
    use it directly. Alternatively, you can use the :program:`scons`
    version which comes with the OMERO source code: ::
    
        cd components/tools/OmeroCpp && python ../../../target/scons/scons.py test
    
    This **does** require having run the top-level build (``build.py``) at
    least once.

.. note::

    If the build fails with errors such as

    ::

        Checking for C++ header file Ice/Ice.h... no
        Fatal Error: Ice/Ice.h not found

    this can be caused by the Ice headers not being installed or not
    being on the search path.  However, also check
    :file:`components/tools/OmeroCpp/config.log`.  If this contains
    error messages such as

    ::

         /usr/include/Ice/ProxyHandle.h:176:13: error: ‘upCast’ was not declared in this scope,
         and no declarations were found by argument-dependent lookup at the point of
         instantiation

    this is caused by the Ice headers being buggy, and newer versions
    of GCC rejecting the invalid code.  To compile in this situation,
    add ``-fpermissive`` to :envvar:`CXXFLAGS` to allow the invalid
    code to be accepted, but do note that this may also mask other
    problems so should not be used unless strictly needed.

Further build configuration
---------------------------

The C++ bindings use `scons <http://www.scons.org>`_ as a build
system. :program:`scons` provides several hooks into its operation.
The following environment variables as defined in
:source:`components/blitz/blitz_tools.py` are considered:

:envvar:`ARCH`
    Either ``x86`` or ``x64``. ``x64`` will be used by default on a
    64-bit machine, otherwise ``x86``

:envvar:`CPPPATH`
    directories to be searched for include files, for example

    .. parsed-literal::

        -I/opt/Ice-|iceversion|/include

    A ``:`` or ``;`` separator character is used to separate
    directories, depending on the platform.

:envvar:`CXXFLAGS`
    standard :program:`make`-like CXXFLAGS variable

:envvar:`CXX`
    compiler executable. Useful with `ccache <http://ccache.samba.org/>`_.

:envvar:`LIBPATH`
    directories to be searched for libraries, for example

    .. parsed-literal::

        -L/opt/Ice-|iceversion|/lib

    Directories are separated by ``:`` or ``;`` as with CPPPATH.

:envvar:`ICE\_HOME`
    your Ice installation. The contained ``include`` directory will be
    added to your :envvar:`CPPPATH`, but the contained ``lib``
    directory will *not* be added to your :envvar:`LIBPATH` since this
    may not contain the needed 32- or 64-bit libraries; this will need
    setting with the correct value for your system.

:envvar:`J`
    specifies the number of concurrent build tasks as with :program:`make`.

:envvar:`RELEASE`
    ``debug`` or ``Os`` (i.e. optimize for size). ``debug`` is used by
    default.

:envvar:`VERBOSE`
    show the actual build commands rather than the pretty "Compiling
    XYZ..." statements.

Zip files containing the C++ header files, the libraries, and source
code are placed under :file:`OMERO\_HOME/target` with other zip
artifacts.

.. note::   

    If you are using :program:`make`, you can unpack the main zip
    (e.g.  :file:`OMERO.cpp-<version>-64dbg.zip`) to some directory
    (:file:`OMERO_DIST`) and follow the instructions below to get
    started. For help with other build systems, please contact the
    mailing list.

Using the library
-----------------

To use |OmeroCpp| it is necessary to point your compiler and linker at
the mentioned directories above. A simple GNU :program:`make`
:file:`Makefile` might look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/omerocpp/Makefile
   :language: make
   :linenos:

A trivial example: :file:`yourcode.cpp`
---------------------------------------

And a simple example file might looking something like the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/omerocpp/yourcode.cpp
   :language: c++
   :linenos:

This code does not do much. It creates a server session, loads a few
services, and prints the user's name. For serious examples, see
|OmeroClients|.

Compiling and running your code
-------------------------------

Therefore, to compile and run :program:`yourcode`, you will need to
download the two files above (:file:`Makefile` and
:file:`yourcode.cpp`) and then from the shell:

::

    make OMERO_DIST=dist yourcode
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=dist/lib ./yourcode --Ice.Config=dist/etc/ice.config

where you have edited :file:`dist/etc/ice.config` to contain the
values:

::

    omero.host=localhost
    omero.user=your_name
    omero.pass=your_password

Alternatively, you can pass these on the command-line:

::

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=dist/lib ./yourcode omero.host=localhost --omero.user=foo --omero.pass=bar

Notes for Mac users
-------------------

This example explains how to build on Linux only. For doing the same
on Mac OS X, change all instances of :envvar:`LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH` to
:envvar:`DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH`.

Notes for Visual Studio users
-----------------------------

The :file:`SConstruct` build file in |OmeroCpp| defines a target
``msproj`` which can be used to generate an MS Visual Studio project
and solution. There is also a similarly named :program:`ant` target:

::

    build -f components\tools\OmeroCpp\build.xml msproj

.. note::

    It may be necessary to specify ``/Zm1000`` as an additional
    compiler setting.
