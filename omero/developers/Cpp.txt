OMERO C++ language bindings
===========================

Using the :zerocdoc:`Ice C++ language mapping
<display/Ice/Hello+World+Application>` from ZeroC_, OMERO provides
native access to your data from C++ code.  `CMake
<http://www.cmake.org/>`_ is used for building the C++
bindings.

**Binaries are not provided**, therefore it will be necessary for you
to compile your own.

Prerequisites
-------------

* The OMERO source code
* A C++ compiler

  * GCC is recommended for Linux and MacOS X
  * :program:`Visual Studio` or the :program:`Platform SDK` for Windows

* The ZeroC :program:`Ice` libraries, headers and slice definitions
* :program:`cmake`
* Google Test (optional; needed to build the unit and integration tests)

Restrictions
------------

Ice 3.4 will only build with GCC versions *older* than 4.6 (it contains
broken headers which newer GCC versions will not parse).  GCC 4.4 is
tested and recommended.  This version will also fail to build with
LLVM/clang++.

Ice 3.5 will build with any GCC version up to 4.9, the latest stable
version; later versions may work, but are untested.  This version
will also build with LLVM/clang++.

The version of GCC and/or Ice provided on your system should be
compatible, but if you are restricted to a particular version of GCC
or Ice, you may need to obtain or build a compatible version of Ice or
GCC, respectively.

Preparing to build
-------------------

Begin by following the instructions under :doc:`/developers/installation` to
acquire the source code. Be **sure** that the git branch you are using
matches the version of your server!

The location of your Ice installation should be automatically detected
if installed into a standard location.  If this is not the case, set
the location of your Ice installation using the :envvar:`ICE\_HOME`
environment variable or the :option:`ICE\_HOME` or
:option:`ICE_SLICE_DIR` cmake options for your Ice installation (see
below).  Some possible locations for the |iceversion| version of Ice
follow. Note these are just examples; you need to adjust them for the
Ice installation path and version in use on your system.

* Ice built from source and installed into :file:`/opt`:

  .. parsed-literal::

      export ICE_HOME=/opt/Ice-|iceversion|

* Ice installed on Linux using RPM packages:

  .. parsed-literal::

      export ICE_HOME=/usr/share/Ice-|iceversion|

* MacOS X with homebrew:

  .. parsed-literal::

      export ICE_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/ice/|iceversion|

* Windows using :program:`Visual Studio`:

  .. parsed-literal::

       set ICE_HOME=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ZeroC\\Ice-|iceversion|

.. note ::

    If the Ice headers and libraries are not automatically discovered,
    these will need to be specified using appropriate cmake options
    (see below).

Building the library
--------------------

For all build methods, the shared library and examples are always
built by default.  The unit and integration tests are built if
Google test (gtest) is detected.

Building with :program:`build.py` or :program:`ant`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    export ICE_HOME=/path/to/ice
    export GTEST_ROOT=/path/to/gtest
    cd /path/to/openmicroscopy
    ./build.py build-default
    ./build.py build-cpp [-Dcmake.args="cmake options"]

Set any needed :program:`cmake` options using the :program:`ant`
``cmake.args`` property, plus any needed environment variables.

For example::

    ./build.py -Dcmake.args="'-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=$CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS' \
    '-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=$CMAKE_LD_FLAGS' \
    '-DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS=$CMAKE_LD_FLAGS' \
    '-DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=$CMAKE_LD_FLAGS' \
    -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON"

This method is present for backward compatibility with the previous
:program:`scons` build system.  While it is possible to customize the
build somewhat, some behavior is hardcoded and so this will not be
suitable for all situations and is not recommended.  Parallel building
is also not supported.  If you wish to have full control over the C++
build or wish to use a cmake generator to build within an IDE, then
running cmake directly is recommended.

Building with :program:`cmake` directly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Linux, Unix or MacOS X with :program:`make`::

    export ICE_HOME=/path/to/ice
    export GTEST_ROOT=/path/to/gtest
    mkdir omero-build
    cd omero-build
    cmake [-Dtest=(TRUE|FALSE)] [cmake options] /path/to/openmicroscopy
    make

For example::

    cmake "-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=$CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS" \
    "-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=$CMAKE_LD_FLAGS" \
    "-DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS=$CMAKE_LD_FLAGS" \
    "-DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=$CMAKE_LD_FLAGS" \
    -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON /path/to/openmicroscopy
    make -j8

Running :program:`cmake` directly allows full use of all command-line
options and provides complete flexibility for building, e.g. to
enable parallel building as shown above or to use an IDE of choice
with an appropriate generator.

If you would like to build the C++ tests, run the above with the
:envvar:`GTEST_ROOT` environment variable set.

.. note::

    When :program:`cmake` is run, it will run ``./build.py
    build-default`` in the openmicroscopy source tree to generate some
    of the C++ and Ice sources.  If you have previously done a build
    by running ``./build.py``, this step will be skipped.  However, if
    you have recently switched branches *without cleaning the source
    tree*, please run ``./build.py clean`` in the source tree to clean
    up all the generated files prior to running :program:`cmake`.

If the build fails with errors such as ::

         /usr/include/Ice/ProxyHandle.h:176:13: error: ‘upCast’ was not declared in this scope,
         and no declarations were found by argument-dependent lookup at the point of
         instantiation

this is caused by the Ice headers being buggy, and newer versions of GCC
rejecting the invalid code. To compile in this situation, add
``-fpermissive`` to :envvar:`CXXFLAGS` to allow the invalid code to be
accepted, but do note that this may also mask other problems so should not be
used unless strictly needed.

:program:`cmake` build configuration
------------------------------------

:program:`cmake` supports configuration of the build using many
different environment variables and options; for a full list, see the
`cmake reference documentation
<http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/documentation.html>`_.  The following
environment variables are commonly needed:

:envvar:`CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH`
    directories to be searched for include files, for example

    .. parsed-literal::

        /opt/Ice-|iceversion|/include

    A ``:`` or ``;`` separator character is used to separate
    directories, depending on the platform.  Note these are used only
    for feature tests, not for passing to the compiler when building,
    for which ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`` is needed.


:envvar:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH`
    directories to be searched for libraries, for example

    .. parsed-literal::

        /opt/Ice-|iceversion|/lib

    Directories are separated by ``:`` or ``;`` as with
    :envvar:`CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH`.  Note these are used only for
    feature tests and finding libraries, not for passing to the linker
    when building, for which ``CMAKE_*_LINKER_FLAGS`` is needed.

:envvar:`CXX`
    C++ compiler executable. Useful with `ccache <http://ccache.samba.org/>`_.

:envvar:`CXXFLAGS`
    C++ compiler flags.  Use of ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`` is preferred.

:envvar:`ICE\_HOME`
    The location of the Ice installation.  If this is not sufficient
    to discover the correct binary and library directories, they may
    otherwise be manually specified with the options below.  Likewise
    for the :file:`include` and :file:`slice` directories.  This may
    also be set as a cmake cache variable (see below).

:envvar:`VERBOSE`
    if set to `1`, show the actual build commands rather than the
    pretty "Compiling XYZ..." statements.

In addition, cmake options may be defined directly when running cmake.
Commonly needed options include:

:option:`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`
    C++ compiler flags.  Use to set any additional linker flags
    desired.

:option:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`
    Executable linker flags. Use to set any additional linker flags
    desired.

:option:`CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS`
    Loadable module linker flags.  Use to set any additional linker
    flags desired.

:option:`CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS`
    Shared library linker flags.  Use to set any additional linker
    flags desired.

:option:`CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE`
    Default to printing all commands executed by make.  This may be
    overridden with the make ``VERBOSE`` variable.

:option:`ICE\_HOME`
    The location of the Ice installation.  If this is not sufficient
    to discover the correct binary and library directories, they may
    otherwise be manually specified with the options below.  Likewise
    for the :file:`include` and :file:`slice` directories.

:option:`ICE_BINARY_DIR`
    location of Ice programs such as :program:`slice2cpp`.  This is
    typically ``${ICE_HOME}/bin`` or on the default :option:`PATH`.
    This will not normally require setting.

:option:`ICE_INCLUDE_DIR`
    location of Ice headers.  This is typically
    ``${ICE_HOME}/include`` or on the default include search path.
    This will not normally require setting.

:option:`ICE_SLICE_DIR`
    location of Ice slice interface definitions.  This is typically
    ``${ICE_HOME}/slice``.  Use for installations where
    :option:`ICE\_HOME` does not contain :file:`slice` or situations
    where you wish to build without setting :option:`ICE\_HOME`.  Note
    that when building using :program:`build.py` the
    :envvar:`SLICEPATH` environment variable should be used instead
    (the ant build can't use the cmake variables).

:option:`ICE_LIBRARY_DIR`
    location of Ice libraries.  This is typically ``${ICE_HOME}/lib``
    or on the default library search path.  This will not normally
    require setting.

:option:`ICE_DEBUG`
    set to ON to print detailed diagnostics about the detected Ice
    installation.  Use if there are any problems finding Ice.

:program:`Visual Studio` configuration
--------------------------------------

.. warning::

    OMERO.cpp will not currently build on Windows due to exceeding DLL
    symbol limits on this platform, leading to a failure when linking
    the DLL.  It is hoped that this platform limitation can be worked
    around in a future OMERO release.

:program:`cmake` has full support for :program:`Visual Studio`.  Use
the cmake :option:`-G` option to set the generator for your Visual
Studio version, with a ``Win64`` suffix for an x64 build.  The correct
Ice programs and libraries for your Ice installation should be
automatically discovered.

::

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" [cmake options] /path/to/openmicroscopy

This is for a 64-bit :program:`Visual Studio 2010` build.  Modify appropriately
for other versions and compilers.  Running

::

    cmake --help

will list the available generators for your platform (without the
``Win64`` suffix).

Once :program:`cmake` has finished running, the generated project and
solution files may be then opened in :program:`Visual Studio`, or
built directly using the :program:`msbuild` command-line tool (make
sure that the :program:`Visual Studio` command prompt matches the
generator chosen) or by running::

    cmake --build .

As for the Unix build, above, it is also possible to build on Windows
using :program:`build.py` or :program:`ant`, providing that you
configure the generator appropriately using the correct cmake options.
However, this will not work for all generators reliably, and the
Windows shell quoting makes passing nested quotes to ant quite tricky,
so running cmake by hand is recommended.

.. note::

    It may be necessary to specify ``/Zm1000`` as an additional
    compiler setting.

Installing the library
----------------------

If using :program:`make`, run:

::

    make [DESTDIR=/path/to/staging/directory] install

If using another build system, please invoke the equivalent install
target for that system.

Using the library
-----------------

To use |OmeroCpp| it is necessary to point your compiler and linker at
the mentioned directories above. A simple GNU :program:`make`
:file:`Makefile` might look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/omerocpp/Makefile
   :language: make
   :linenos:

A trivial example: :file:`yourcode.cpp`
---------------------------------------

A simple example might look something like the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/omerocpp/yourcode.cpp
   :language: c++
   :linenos:

This code does not do much. It creates a server session, loads a few
services, and prints the user's name. For serious examples, see
|OmeroClients|.

Compiling and running your code
-------------------------------

To compile and run :program:`yourcode`, download the two files above
(:file:`Makefile` and :file:`yourcode.cpp`) and then in a shell:

::

    make OMERO_DIST=dist yourcode
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=dist/lib ./yourcode --Ice.Config=dist/etc/ice.config

where you have edited :file:`dist/etc/ice.config` to contain the
values:

::

    omero.host=localhost
    omero.user=your_name
    omero.pass=your_password

Alternatively, you can pass these on the command-line:

::

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=dist/lib ./yourcode omero.host=localhost --omero.user=foo --omero.pass=bar

.. note::

    This example explains how to run on Linux only. For doing the
    same on MacOS X, change all instances of
    :envvar:`LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH` to :envvar:`DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH`.
