OMERO.fs
========

OMERO.fs currently consists of two components:

OMERO.fs DropBox is designed for watching a
directory and kicking off an automatic import. The configuration of the
DropBox system is covered on the :doc:`/sysadmins/server-fs` system 
administrator's page.

OMERO.fs-lite is designed to allow
system administrators to point OMERO at an existing directory without
requiring the data duplication that was carried out by a pre-5.0 import. The 
changes to the import system mean that an OMERO.fs server stores the original 
files in the ``ManagedRepository``, preserving file names and any nested 
directory structure. This improves the way OMERO deals with HCS and other 
complex heterogeneous data types, reducing storage requirements and using 
Bio-Formats to recognize 'filesets' (groups of files which correspond to 
multi-dimensional images and accompanying information) so they can be treated 
as single entities within the OMERO clients.
