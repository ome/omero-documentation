OMERO.fs
========

OMERO.fs is a series of on-going changes designed to improve the way an 
OMERO.server interacts with existing directories of acquired image data. It 
currently consists of two components:

OMERO.fs DropBox is designed for watching a
directory and kicking off an automatic import. The configuration of the
DropBox system is covered on the :doc:`/sysadmins/server-fs` system 
administrator's page.

OMERO.fs-lite is designed to store original data in an unaltered form without
requiring the data duplication that was carried out by a pre-5.0 import. The 
changes to the import system mean that an OMERO.fs server stores the original 
files in the ``ManagedRepository``, preserving file names and any nested 
directory structure. This improves the way OMERO deals with High Content 
Screening (HCS) and other 
complex heterogeneous data types, reducing storage requirements and using 
Bio-Formats to recognize 'filesets' (groups of files which correspond to 
multi-dimensional images and accompanying information) so they can be treated 
as single entities within the OMERO clients.
