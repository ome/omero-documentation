OMERO.fs
========

OMERO.fs is a series of on-going changes designed to improve the way an 
OMERO.server interacts with existing directories of acquired image data. These 
changes are currently being implemented almost exclusively in the OMERO 5 
development line. In OMERO version 4.4, OMERO.fs consists of a single 
component:

OMERO.dropbox is designed for watching a directory and kicking off an 
automatic import. The configuration of the DropBox system is covered on the 
:doc:`OMERO.dropbox </sysadmins/dropbox>` system administratorâ€™s page.
