Introduction to OMERO.scripts
============================= 

OMERO.scripts are the OME version of plugins, allowing you to extend the 
functionality of your OMERO installation.

The OMERO scripting service allows scripts to be uploaded to the server so 
that image processing and analysis, and other functionality, can be carried 
out there rather than on your local machine. Scripts are generally written in 
Python but MATLAB scripts are also supported (currently using a Python wrapper 
as described in :doc:`matlab-scripts`, but native support will be available 
soon). Scripts can be run from the OMERO clients, using a UI generated from 
the script and the results should also be handled where relevant e.g. 
allowing users to view OMERO Images or Datasets created by the script, or 
download files or images.

Finding scripts
---------------

Core scripts are bundled with every OMERO.server release and automatically 
available to all users. You can find additional scripts via the new 
:community_plone:`script sharing <scripts>` page.

Installing and running scripts
------------------------------

The easiest way to make use of scripts is for someone with admin rights to 
upload them to the OMERO.server as described in the :doc:`user-guide`. Once a 
script has been added under the lib/scripts directory, you can run them from 
the OMERO clients or the command line.

Writing scripts
---------------

:doc:`user-guide` describes the workflows for developing and running your own 
scripts. You should use the :doc:`style-guide` to ensure your script interacts 
with the OMERO clients in a usable way.

Managing scripts
----------------

To keep your scripts up to date, we recommend you use a Github repository to 
manage your scripts. If you are not familiar with 
:doc:`/developers/using-git`, you can use the 
`Github app for your OS <http://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git>`_ 
(available for Mac and Windows). The basic workflow is:

-  fork our 
   `omero-user-script <https://github.com/joshmoore/omero-user-scripts>`_ 
   repository
-  clone it in your lib/scripts directory

   ::

           cd lib/scripts; 
           git clone git@github.com:YOURGITUSERNAME/omero-user-scripts.git YOUR_SCRIPTS

-  save the scripts you want to use into the appropriate sub-directory in your 
   cloned location lib/scripts/YOUR_SCRIPTS

Your new scripts will then show up in the script menu in the clients, 
alongside the core scripts which are shipped with each release. This means you 
should try to pick unique names to avoid future clashes e.g. 
lib/scripts/FLIM_Scripts:

The OME developers use Github to co-ordinate all our development work so 
joining the network will help you access help and support, and see what other 
people are doing with scripts. Cloning our repository also means you have an 
example script to get you started with developing your own.

Contributing back to the community
----------------------------------

If you have modified one of the core scripts or developed your own that you 
would like to contribute back to the community, please get in touch. We 
can either add your repository to the list on the 
:community_plone:`script sharing <scripts>` page so people can find it, or if 
the script is likely to have wide appeal, we can look into adding it to the 
core scripts that are distributed with an OMERO release.
