Running and writing tests
=========================

The following guidelines apply to tests in both the Java and Python test
components. Please make sure to verify the path and file extension before
running tests to avoid confusion.

Running unit tests
------------------

The unit testing framework is fairly simple. Only methods which contain
logic written within OMERO are tested. This means that framework
functionality like remoting or the Hibernate layer is not tested. This is a
part of integration testing (see below).

You can run the unit tests for any component from its directory by
entering:

::

    ./build.py -f components/<component>/build.xml test

The same can be done for all components using:

::

    ./build.py test-unit

Note that for tests written in Python the package `pytest` must be installed,
see :ref:`writing-python-tests`.

Running integration tests
-------------------------

Integration testing is a bit more complex because of the reliance on a
database, which is not easily mockable. All Hibernate-related classes
are tested in integration mode.

The tests require a fast computer. Running all the integration tests
places several restrictions on the environment:

- There must be a running OMERO database.
- An OMERO.server instance must be running.

Integration tests assume that:

- :envvar:`ICE_CONFIG` has been properly set. The contents of the
  :file:`etc/ice.config` file should be enough to configure a running server
  for integration testing. This means that code creating a client connection
  as outlined in 
  :omero_doc:`developers/GettingStarted/AdvancedClientDevelopment.html` 
  should execute without errors.
- An OMERO.server instance is running on the host and port specified in
  the :envvar:`ICE_CONFIG` file.

If any of the tests fail with a user authentication exception (or
``omero.client`` throws an exception), a new :file:`ice.config` file can be
created and pointed to by the :envvar:`ICE_CONFIG` environment variable.
Most likely the first settings that will have to be put there will be
``omero.user`` and ``omero.pass``.

Running all tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the integration tests can be run using:

::

    ./build.py test-integration

Component tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Running an integration test suite for an individual component can be done
explicitly via:

::

    ./build.py -f components/<component>/build.xml integration

Results are placed in ``components/<component>/target/reports``.

Individual test groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run individual groups (or sets of groups separated by a comma) of tests,
the :option:`-DGROUPS` parameter can be used together with the
:option:`test` target

::

    ./build.py -f components/tools/OmeroJava/build.xml test -DGROUPS=integration


Individual tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, you can run individual tests which you may currently be
working on. This can be done by using the :option:`test` option. For example:

::

    ./build.py -f components/tools/OmeroJava/build.xml test -DTEST=integration/AdminTest
    ./build.py -f components/tools/OmeroPy/build.xml test -DTEST=test/integration/test_admin.py

Individual test class methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Individual test class methods (or a comma separated list of methods) can be
run using the :option:`-DMETHODS` parameter together with the :option:`test`
target. The method to be run has to be in the FQN form (:option:`package.class.method`).

::

    ./build.py -f components/tools/OmeroJava/build.xml test -DMETHODS=integration.chgrp.AnnotationMoveTest.testMoveTaggedImage


Using markers in OmeroPy tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tests under OmeroPy can be included or excluded according to markers defined in the tests.
This can be done by using the :option:`-DMARK` option. For example:

::

    ./build.py -f components/tools/OmeroPy/build.xml integration -DMARK=long_running

See :ref:`writing-python-tests` for more information on this.

Failing tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :option:`test.with.fail` ant property is set to ``false`` by default,
which prevents test failures from failing the build. However, it can instead
be set to ``true`` to allow test failures to fail the build. For example:

::

    ./build.py -Dtest.with.fail=true integration

Some components might provide individual targets for specific tests (e.g.
OmeroJava provides the :option:`broken` target for running broken tests).
The :file:`build.xml` file is the reference in each component.

Using Eclipse to run tests
--------------------------

There are currently :file:`.project` and :file:`.classpath-template`
files stored in git in each component directory (e.g. :source:`common's
.classpath <components/common/.classpath-template>` and
:source:`common's .project </components/common/.project>`).

There are also top-level :file:`.classpath` and :file:`.project` files which
contain the entire project, but this approach requires more memory and
does not clearly differentiate the classpaths, and so can lead to confusion.

All the Eclipse projects require a successful build to have taken place:

::

    ./build.py

This is for two reasons. Firstly, the Eclipse projects are not configured to
perform the code generation needed. The :command:`build.py` command creates
the directory:

::

    <component>/target

which will be missing from any Eclipse project you open before building
the source.

Secondly, Ivy is used to copy all the jar dependencies from
``OMERO_SOURCE_PREFIX/lib/repository`` to ``<component>/target/libs``, which
is then used in the Eclipse :file:`.classpath` files.

If Eclipse ever gets out of sync after the first build,
:command:`./build.py build-eclipse` can be used to quickly synchronize.

TestNG plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A prerequisite of running unit and integration tests in the Eclipse UI is
having the TestNG plug-in installed and working (help available on the
`TestNG site <http://testng.org/doc/eclipse.html>`_).

Unit tests
^^^^^^^^^^

Running the unit tests under Eclipse requires no extra settings and is as
easy as navigating to the package or class context menu :guilabel:`Run As`
or :guilabel:`Debug As`, then selecting :guilabel:`TestNG`.

Integration tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Integration tests require the :envvar:`ICE_CONFIG` environment variable to
be available for the Eclipse-controlled JVM. This can be done by editing
Debug/Run configurations in Eclipse. After navigating to the Debug (or Run)
Configurations window, the :guilabel:`Environment` tab needs to be selected.
After clicking :guilabel:`New`, :envvar:`ICE_CONFIG` can be defined as a
path to the :file:`ice.config` file. This setting needs to be defined per
package, class or method.

Writing Java tests
------------------

For more information on writing tests in general see `<http://testng.org>`_. 
For a test to be an "integration" test, place it in the "integration" 
TestNG group. If a test is temporarily broken, add it to the "broken" group:

::

    @Test(groups = {"integration", "broken"}
    public void testMyStuff() {

    }

Tests should be of the **Acceptance Test** form. The ticket number
for which a test is being written should be added in the TestNG annotation:

::

    @Test(groups = "ticket:60")

This works at either the method level (see :source:`SetsAndLinksTest.java
<components/model/test/ome/model/utests/SetsAndLinksTest.java>`)
or the class level (see :source:`UniqueResultTest.java
<components/server/test/ome/server/itests/query/UniqueResultTest.java>`).

OmeroJava
^^^^^^^^^

The tests under :sourcedir:`components/tools/OmeroJava/test` will be the
starting point for most Java-client developers coming to OMERO. An example
skeleton for an integration test looks similar to

::

    @Test(groups = "integration")
    public class MyTest {

      omero.client client;

      @BeforeClass
      protected void setup() throws Exception {
        client = new omero.client();
        client.createSession();
      }

      @AfterClass
      protected void tearDown() throws Exception {
        client.closeSession();
      }

      @Test
      public void testSimple() throws Exception {
        client.getSession().getAdminService().getEventContext();
      }

    }

.. _writing-python-tests:

Writing Python tests
--------------------

To write and run Python tests you first need to install `pytest`:

::

    pip install pytest

For more information on writing tests in general see `<http://pytest.org>`_.

OmeroPy
^^^^^^^

Similar to the OmeroJava tests, the tests under
:sourcedir:`components/tools/OmeroPy/test` will be the starting point
for most Python-client developers coming to OMERO. Integration tests should
be placed under :sourcedir:`components/tools/OmeroPy/test/integration`.
The file names must begin with `test_` for the tests to be found by `pytest`.

::

    import omero

    class TestExample(object)

      def setup_method(self, method):
        client = new omero.client()
        client.createSession()

      def teardown_method(self, method):
        client.closeSession()

      def testSimple():
        ec = client.getSession().getAdminService().getEventContext()
        assert ec, "No EventContext!"

Running tests directly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When writing tests it can be more convenient, flexible and powerful to run the
tests from :sourcedir:`components/tools/OmeroPy` using :file:`setup.py`. Since
Python is interpreted, tests can be written and then run without having to
rebuild or restart the server. A few basic examples are shown below.

Run a single test file:
::

    cd components/tools/OmeroPy
    ./setup.py test -s test/integration/test_admin.py

The :option:`-k` option will run all integration tests containing the given
string in their names. For example, to run all the tests under
:file:`test/integration` with `permissions` in their names:

::

    ./setup.py test -s test/integration -k permissions

This option can also be used to run a named test within a test module:

::

    ./setup.py test -s test/integration/test_admin.py -k testGetGroup

The :option:`-m` option will run integration tests depending on the markers
they are decorated with. For example, to run all integration tests excluding
those decorated with the marker `long_running`:

::

    ./setup.py test -s test/integration -m "not long_running"

For more help with :file:`setup.py` see:

::

    ./setup.py --help test

To make use of the more advanced options available in `pytest` that are not
assessible using :file:`setup.py`, the script :file:`py.pest` can be used directly.
For example, to run the tests in a single package allowing standard output
to be shown on the console:

::

    py.test test/integration/test_admin.py -s

For a full list of options see:

::

    py.test --help

and `<http://pytest.org/latest/usage.html>`_ for more help in running tests.

Debugging a running OMERO instance
----------------------------------

By using the "debug" target from templates.xml, it is possible to have
OMERO listen on port 8787 for a debugging connection.

::

    bin/omero admin stop
    bin/omero admin start debug

Then in Eclipse, you can create a new "Debug" configuration by clicking
on "Remote Java Application", and setting the port to 8787. These
values are arbitrary and can be changed locally.

**Keep in mind**:

- The server will not start up until you have connected with Eclipse. This
  is due to the "suspend=y" clause in templates.xml. If you would like
  the server to start without you connecting, use "suspend=n".
- If you take too much time examining your threads, your calls may
  throw timeout exceptions.
