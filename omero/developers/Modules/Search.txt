OMERO search
============

Beginning with 3.0-Beta3, the OMERO server will use
` Lucene <http://lucene.apache.org>`_ to index all string and timestamp
information in the database, as well as all ``OriginalFiles`` which can
be parsed to simple text (see :doc:`/developers/Search/FileParsers` for
more information). The index is stored under /OMERO/FullText (or the
``FullText`` subdirectory of your ${omero.data.dir}, and can be searched
with Google-like queries.

Field names
-----------

Each row in the database becomes a single Lucene ``Document`` parsed
into the several ``Fields``. A field is referenced by prefixing a search
term with the field name followed by a colon. For example,
`name:myImage` searches for myImage anywhere in the name field.

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{3.5cm}|p{12cm}|

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 20 80
    :header-rows: 1
    :file: searchfieldnames.tsv
    :delim: tab

Queries
-------

Search queries are very similar to Google searches. When search terms
are entered without a prefix ("name:"), then the default field will be
used which combines all available fields. Otherwise, a prefix can be
added to restrict the search.

Indexing
--------

Successful searching depends on understanding how the text is indexed.
The default analyzer used is :source:`the
FullTextAnalyzer <components/server/src/ome/services/fulltext/FullTextAnalyzer.java>`.

::

      1. Desktop/image_GFP-H2B_1.dv  --->  "desktop", "image", "gfp", "h2b", "1", "dv"
      2. Desktop/image_GFP-H2B_2.dv  --->  "desktop", "image", "gfp", "h2b", "2", "dv
      3. Desktop/image_GFP_01-H2B.dv --->  "desktop", "image", "gfp", "01", "h2b", "dv"
      4. Desktop/image_GFP-CSFV_a.dv --->  "desktop", "image", "gfp", "csfv", "a", "dv"

Assuming these entries above for Image.name:

-  searching for **GFP-H2B** returns 1 and 2.
-  searching for **"GFP H2B"** also returns 1 and 2.
-  searching for **GFP H2B** returns 1, 2, and 3, since the two terms
   are joined by an **OR**.

Information for developers and system administrators
----------------------------------------------------

Scheduling indexing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Indexing is not driven by the user, but happens automatically in the
background. Automatic indexing occurs at the frequency defined in
etc/omero.properties:

::

    omero.search.cron=0,30 * * * * ?
    omero.search.batch=100

which implies every thirty seconds of every hour, day, month, year, etc.
During each iteration, 100 ``EventLogs`` will be loaded from the
database and processed. Upon successful completion, the persistent count
in the ``configuration`` table, will be incremented.

::

    omero3=# select value from configuration where name = 'PersistentEventLogLoader.current_id';
     value 
    -------
     30983
    (1 row)

If you have more than one ``PersistentEventLogLoader.*`` value in your
database, then you have run indexing with multiple versions of the
server. This is fine. To allow a new server version to force an update,
the configuration key may be changed. For example,

::

       PersistentEventLogLoader.currend_id

became

::

       PersistentEventLogLoader.v2.current_id

in r2460.

Once an entity is indexed, it is possible to start writing querying
against the server via ``IQuery.findAllByFullText()``. Use
``new Parameters(new Filter().owner())`` and ``.group()`` to restrict
your search. Or alternatively use the ``oma.api.Search`` interface
(below).

.. _search-reindexing:

Re-indexing
^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few reasons that you may need to re-index your database, e.g. if the
index has become corrupt or you would like to have large files, that were
previously skipped, added to the index (see :ref:`omero_search_max_file_size`).
Under most circumstances, you should be able to re-index the database while the
server is still running.

If you need to make any adjustments to the server configuration or the process
heap size, first shut the server down and make these changes before restarting
the server. Then, with the server running, using the following steps to initiate
a re-indexing

-  Disable the search indexer process and stop any currently running indexer
   processes:

   ::

       > bin/omero admin ice server disable Indexer-0
       > bin/omero admin ice server stop Indexer-0

-  Remove the existing search Indexes by deleting the contents of the
   ``FullText`` subdirectory of your ${omero.data.dir}

-  Reset the indexer's progress counter in the database

   ::

       > psql -U <omero-db-user> <omero-db-name> -c "update configuration set value = 0 where name like 'PersistentEventLogLoader%';"

   substituting in your local omero database's user and name

-  Re-enable/restart the indexer process (the Ice grid will handle automatically
   restarting the process as soon as it is re-enabled)

   ::

       > bin/omero admin ice server enable Indexer-0

Depending on the size of your database, it may take the indexer some time to
finish re-indexing. During this time, your OMERO server will remain available
for use, however the search functionality will be degraded until the re-indexing
is finished.

It is also possible to re-index the database with the server off-line. First,
shutdown the OMERO server as normal and make any adjustments to the
configuration that need to be made. Clear the contents of the ``FullText``
directory, then run

::

   > bin/omero admin reindex --full

Re-indexing the database in off-line mode will use a 1 GB heap by default (as
opposed to the default 256MB heap for the indexer process in the running
server). You can further adjust the size of the heap by passing an alternate
value in the ``JAVA_OPTS`` variable on the command line

::

   > JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx2056MB" bin/omero admin reindex --full

You may also want to increase the :ref:`omero_search_batch` size to take
advantage of the larger heap. The combination of a larger heap and batch size
should enable the re-index to complete sooner in off-line mode than it might in
the context of a running server.

Alternatively, you can re-index a specific class of objects in off-line mode,
followed by a later re-index with the server running. Start by shutting down the
server and clearing the contents of the ``FullText`` directory. Then reindex a
specific class of object with

::

   > bin/omero admin reindex --class ome.model.core.Image

Multiple classes can be re-indexed together by appending extra ``--class ...``
arguments on the command-line. Once this limited re-indexing is completed, you
can restart the server and search capabilities will be available in a limited
fashion. If you would then like to re-index the remaining objects in the system,
follow the steps for the on-line reindexing above, skipping the step that
involves clearing the ``FullText`` directory.


ome.api.IQuery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current IQuery implementation restricts searches to a single class
at a time.

-  ``findAllByFullText(Image.class, "metaphase")`` -- Images which
   contain or are annotated with "metaphase"
-  ``findAllByFullText(Image.class, "annotation:metaphase")`` -- Images
   which are annotated with "metaphase"
-  ``findAllByFullText(Image.class, "tag:metaphase")`` -- Images which
   are tagged with "metaphase" (specialization of the previous)
-  ``findAllByFullText(Image.class, "file.contents:metaphase")`` --
   Images which have files attached containing "metaphase"
-  ``findAllByFullText(OriginalFile.class, "file.contents:metaphase")``
   -- File containing "metaphase"

ome.api.Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Search API offers a number of different queries along with various
filters and settings which are all maintained on the server.

The matrix below show which combinations of parameters and queries are
supported (S), will throw an exception (X), and which will simply silently be
ignored (I).

Leading wildcard searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Leading wildcard searches are disallowed by default. "?omething" or
"\*hatever", for example, would both throw exceptions. They can be run by 
using:

::

      Search search = serviceFactory.createSearchService();
      search.setAllowLeadingWildcards(true);

There is a performance penalty, however. In addition,
wildcard searches get expanded on the server to boolean queries. For
example, assuming "ACELL", "BCELL", and "CCELL" are all terms in your
index, then the query:

::

      *CELL

gets expanded to:

::

      ACELL OR BCELL OR CCELL

If there are more than "omero.search.maxclause" terms in the expansion
(default is 4096), then an exception will be thrown. This requires the
user to enter a more refined search, but not because there are too many
results, only because there is not enough room in memory to search on
all terms at once.

Extension points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two extension points are currently available for searching. The first
are the :doc:`/developers/Search/FileParsers` mentioned above. By
configuring the map of Formats (roughly mime-types) of files to parser
instances, extracting information from attached binary files can be made
quick and straightforward.

Similarly, :doc:`/developers/Modules/Search/Bridges` provide a mechanism
for parsing all metadata entering the system. One built in bridge (the
:source:`FullTextBridge <components/server/src/ome/services/fulltext/FullTextBridge.java>`)
parses out the fields mentioned above, but by creating your own bridge
it is possible to extract more information specific to your site.
