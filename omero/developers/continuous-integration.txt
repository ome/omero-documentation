Versioning
^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

	Major release

		What Sphinx_ calls a “version number” is defined on Wikipedia_ as a
		“minor number” and in OME is typically considered a major release,
		e.g. |version|.

	Point release

		Similarly, a Sphinx_ “release number” is a “revision number” on
		Wikipedia_ and an OME point release, e.g. |release|.

Development branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most of the OME code is split between four repositories: openmicroscopy.git_,
bioformats.git_, scripts.git_, ome-documentation.git_. For each repository,
two development branches are maintained simultaneously:

* the |devbranch| branch ("stable" branch) contains work on the stable release
  version and will only be released as a point release

* the develop branch contains work on the next major release.

It is possible to have a point release immediately, while still working on
more major releases by ensuring that (nearly) all commits that are applied to
|devbranch| are applied to develop in order to prevent regressions.

Labels
^^^^^^

Labels are applied to PRs on GitHub under the “Issues” tab of each repository.

The next point release consists of PRs labelled with “|devbranch|”, which is
the name of the branch which they will be merged into.

The next major release consists of PRs labelled with “develop”, which is also
the name of the branch which they will be merged into.

Two labels are used in the PR reviewing process: “include” and “exclude”. The
“include” label allows you to include a PR opened by a non-member of the OME
organization in the merge builds for review. The “exclude” label allows you to
exclude a PR opened by any user from the merge builds.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For all jobs building documentation using Sphinx, the following environment
variables are used:

- the Sphinx building options, :envvar:`SPHINXOPTS`, is set to
  ``-W -D html_theme=plone_match``,

- the release number of the documentation is set by :envvar:`OMERO_RELEASE`,
  :envvar:`BF_RELEASE` or :envvar:`FORMATS_RELEASE`,

- the source code links use :envvar:`SOURCE_USER` and :envvar:`SOURCE_BRANCH`,

- for the Bio-Formats and OMERO sets of documentation, the name of the
  Jenkins job is set by :envvar:`JENKINS_JOB`.

.. _linkcheck_parser:

Linkcheck output parser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _Warnings Plugin: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Warnings+Plugin

The :file:`output.txt` file generated by Sphinx ``linkcheck`` builder is
parsed using the `Warnings Plugin`_. Depending on the nature of the links,
warnings are generated as described in the following table:

====== ================ ========
Type   Error code       Priority
====== ================ ========
local                   High
broken HTTP Error 404   Normal
broken Anchor not found Normal
broken HTTP Error 403   Low
====== ================ ========

The build is marked as FAILED or UNSTABLE if the number of warnings of a given
category exceeds a threshold. The table below lists the thresholds used for
all the documentation builds:

======== ====== ========
Priority FAILED UNSTABLE
======== ====== ========
High     0
Normal          0
Low             10
======== ====== ========
