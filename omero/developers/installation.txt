Installing OMERO from source
============================

Code locations
--------------

The main repository for OMERO, known as ome.git, is available from:

-  https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy
-  git://openmicroscopy.org/ome.git

Installing git
--------------

In general, see the Git `downloads page <http://git-scm.com/download>`_ for
installation options.

Linux
^^^^^

Most flavors of Linux have git available through the package manager. For
example, on Debian or Ubuntu::

        sudo apt-get install git

Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

You can install git using `Homebrew <https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/>`_::

        brew install git

Or you can use the `binary installer <http://git-scm.com/download>`_.

Windows
^^^^^^^

We recommend using either msysGit_ for a basic git installation, or Cygwin_
for a full-featured Unix-style environment that includes git. You can also use
TortoiseGit_ for git shell integration. You may also want to consider
installing VirtualBox_ with a Linux guest OS to make your life easier. Lastly,
when using git on Windows, please be aware of the `CRLF conversion issue`_.

Git configuration
-----------------

If you are looking to get started as quickly as possible, the minimum you will
need is to have Git installed and then::

        git config --global user.name "Full name"
        git config --global user.email YOUR_EMAIL
        git clone --recursive https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy
        cd openmicroscopy

You will not be able to push back to this repository, but you will at least
have something you can start looking at.

Git provides a number of options which can make working with it considerably
more pleasant. These configuration options are available either globally in
:file:`$HOME/.gitconfig` or in the :file:`.git` directory of your repository.
The file is in INI-format, but can also be modified using the ``git config``
command, as illustrated in the examples following.

The most important thing is to update your 'global' credentials that are used
in your commits. These values are saved in :file:`~/.gitconfig`::

        git config --global user.name "Full name"
        git config --global user.email YOUR_EMAIL

If you have a PGP key for signing commits and tags, you may want to add it as
well::

        git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_PGP_KEY_ID

Color and display options make log and diff output much more friendly::

         git config --global color.ui true
         git config --global color.diff auto
         git config --global color.graph auto
         git config --global color.status auto
         git config --global color.branch auto

         git config --global core.ui always
         git config --global core.editor mate_wait

Aliases provide a way to make shortcuts for longer git commands. One that is
often used among the OME team is ``graph``::

         git config --global alias.graph "log --date-order --graph --decorate --oneline"

See `Helpful command aliases`_ for more examples.

Cloning the source code
-----------------------

Most OME development is currently happening on GitHub, therefore it is highly
suggested that you become familiar with how it works, if not create an account
for yourself.

Start by cloning the official repository::

        git clone https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy.git

Since the openmicroscopy repository now makes use of submodules, you first
need to initialize all the submodules::

        cd openmicroscopy
        git submodule update --init

Alternatively, with version 1.6.5 of git and later, you can pass the
:option:`--recursive` option to git clone and initialize all submodules::

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy.git

The natural workflow when using GitHub is not just to download someone else’s
repository, but also to create a personal working copy. Go to the repository
page at `<https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy>`_ and click on
“Fork”. This will create a copy of the repository in your own personal space::

        https://github.com/YOURNAME/openmicroscopy

which can be added to your local repository as another remote::

        git remote add gh git@github.com:YOURNAME/openmicroscopy.git

.. note::
    For the |SSH| transport to work, you will need to follow some of the
    instructions under https://github.com/account/ssh

Depending on which repository you cloned first, either origin/develop or
gh/develop will be the “develop” branch of your own fork of
openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy. The example below assumes that “gh” is your own
personal GitHub repository, and “origin” is the official openmicroscopy
repository.

You may even want to remove the “develop” branch from your fork since all
branching should happen from the official develop branch. If you’d prefer to
keep a copy of “develop” in “gh”, that is fine, but you may then need to keep
your develop up-to-date with the official develop::

        git checkout develop
        git reset --hard origin/develop   # Warning: This will delete any unsaved changes and commits to develop!
        git push -f gh develop            # Warning: This will replace gh/develop with the official version remotely.


Installing OMERO
----------------

To install the dependencies required to run the OMERO.server on Linux
or Mac OS X, take a look at the
:doc:`/sysadmins/unix/server-installation` or the
:doc:`/sysadmins/unix/server-install-homebrew` sections.
