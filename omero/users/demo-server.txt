*****************
OMERO demo server
*****************


Take advantage of the OMERO platform and ask for a free demo account.

To register for a free demo account, please visit
`the registration page <http://qa.openmicroscopy.org.uk/registry/demo_account/>`_.

We will contact you and provide you with a server name, username and password,
please be patient as it may take a few days to process your application after
we receive it.


**If you have already requested a demonstration account:**

- your username and password will be emailed to you.

Once you have these, follow the instructions below:


Getting started with your demo account
======================================

To log on and try the demo server you have three options:

1. :ref:`OMEROinsight`

Download the OMERO.insight client for your platform, install it and run it as
a stand-alone application. You will need to have permissions allowing you to
install software on your computer, and you will need to update the client if
the demo server is upgraded (we will email you to inform you).

2. :ref:`JavaWeb`

This automatically downloads the current version of the client, ensuring you
are not using an out-of-date version, but it requires re-downloading each
session.  Depending on the individual security and Java set-up on your
computer, you may find you cannot use Web Start.

3. :ref:`OMEROweb`

The web client does not allow you to import data or use the measurement tools.
