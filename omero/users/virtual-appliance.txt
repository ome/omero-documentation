OMERO virtual appliance
=======================

The OMERO virtual appliance is a quick, easy, and low-cost way to try
out OMERO.server on your laptop or desktop. This enables you to make
an informed decision about whether committing to an OMERO.server
install is right for you.

Virtualization enables canned, ready to run software environments to be
created and used, in the form of |VM|, or to be
distributed for others to use, in the form of virtual appliances. A
Virtual Appliance is essentially a file that describes how to create a
new Virtual Machine on demand. The virtualized software environment can
contain an entire |OS|, such as Windows or Linux, and
any other software that runs in that |OS|, such as, in this case,
OMERO.server and its associated software prerequisites. Once created and
started, you can log into the |OS| and use it as though it were a real
machine. One way to think of this is as though you had an entire
computer in a window on your desktop.

When using virtualization software, the |OS| that is running the
virtualization software is referred to as the "**host OS**". When you
use virtualization, the |OS| running within a virtual machine is referred
to as the "**guest OS**". This allows us to be explicit about which |OS|
we are working in.

This technology allows the OME Project to distribute a canned,
ready-to-run environment containing an OMERO.server, freeing you
from having to install the server and prerequisites yourself, and letting you
concentrate on evaluating the functionality of the OMERO platform.

.. note:: 
    The virtual hard-drive used by the OMERO virtual appliance is
    30GB in size and you should keep track of the amount of this
    space you have consumed and, if necessary, delete data that is not
    required. If your data is likely to exceed this space whilst you are
    evaluating OMERO then it is worthwhile going through the 
    :ref:`increasing-hd-size` before you start working with
    OMERO in earnest.

Getting started
---------------

To use the virtual appliance you should do the following:

-  Install VirtualBox
-  Download the OMERO.server virtual appliance
-  Import the virtual appliance into VirtualBox to create a virtual
   machine
-  Start the virtual machine

Each of these points is outlined in more detail below.

Install VirtualBox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download VirtualBox from the
`VirtualBox Downloads page <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_ and 
follow the installation process for your platform. If in doubt, you should 
download, or upgrade to, the latest version of VirtualBox. Once VirtualBox is
installed, run the application. Depending upon your platform and version,
the VirtualBox interface should look similar to the following
screenshot:

   :alt: VirtualBox installation

   VirtualBox installation

Download the OMERO.server virtual appliance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The virtual appliance can be downloaded from the 
:downloads:`OMERO download page <>` 
and should have a filename similar to, e.g. omero-vm-|release|.ova

Import OMERO virtual appliance into VirtualBox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Start VirtualBox then select **'File/Import Appliance'**. You will be
   presented with a dialogue box.
-  Select and navigate to the location where you downloaded the
   the virtual appliance file.
-  Select your OVA file then click **open**.

This process is indicated in the screenshot below.

   :figwidth: 65%
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Import of the OMERO virtual appliance

   Import of the OMERO virtual appliance

-  Click **continue**. You will be presented with a range of options for
   the |VM| that will be built from the appliance.

   :align: center
   :figwidth: 65%
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Virtual appliance import settings

   Virtual appliance import settings

-  You can accept the defaults by clicking **Import**.

You should now see a progress bar as your new virtual machine is built
from the appliance. This may take a few minutes depending upon your hardware.

When the import procedure is complete, your new |VM| should appear in the
VirtualBox |VM| library ready for use.

Networking
^^^^^^^^^^

Our virtual appliance is distributed with VirtualBox's built in
Host-Only Network Address Translation (NAT) preconfigured. This means
that the IP address for the |VM| is 10.0.2.15 as this is the default
VirtualBox Host-Only NAT address. Using this address is the simplest way
to distribute a virtual appliance when you do not know the setup of a
user's network.

.. _virtualappliance_portforwarding:

Port-forwarding settings
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Your host |OS| cannot connect directly to 10.0.2.15 but needs to use
port-forwarding. This means that you connect to your localhost on a
specific port and the communications to and from that port are forwarded
to specified ports on the guest |VM|.

Our virtual appliance should be preconfigured with the correct
port-forwarding setting during the import process. However,
it is best to double check that these settings are correct:

-  Select your |VM| in the VirtualBox |VM| Library
-  Click on **Settings** then select the **Network** tab
-  Click on **Advanced**
-  Click on **Port Forwarding**

If the table in the window that appears is empty then port forwarding is
not setup. The required port-forwarding settings are as follows:

=========== ======== ========= ========= ========= ==========
Name        Protocol Host IP   Host Port Guest IP  Guest Port
=========== ======== ========= ========= ========= ==========
omero-ssl   TCP      127.0.0.1 4064      10.0.2.15  4064
omero-unsec TCP      127.0.0.1 4063      10.0.2.15  4063
omero-web   TCP      127.0.0.1 8080      10.0.2.15  8080
ssh         TCP      127.0.0.1 2222      10.0.2.15  22
=========== ======== ========= ========= ========= ==========

When correctly setup in VirtualBox, your port forwarding settings should
look like this:

.. figure:: /images/virtual-appliance-4portforwarding.jpg
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 65%
   :width: 60%
   :alt: VirtualBox port forwarding

   VirtualBox port forwarding

If you are on Linux or Mac OS X, you can either use our port
forwarding setup script or you can set up port forwarding manually. 

On Microsoft Windows systems you will have to set up port forwarding manually
as the script requires a Bash shell.

.. only:: html

    The script is in the file :download:`setup_port_forwarding.sh </downloads/setup_port_forwarding.sh>` (click to view or download).

.. only:: latex

    The script can be downloaded from the online version of this documentation 
    - see `<http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero/users/virtual-appliance.html>`_.

After obtaining the script, it can be used in the following manner:
::

    $ bash setup_port_forwarding.sh $VMNAME

where $VMNAME is the name of your |VM|. 

.. note:: 
    By default the scripts create a |VM| named **omerovm** and the
    pre-built appliance is named **omero-vm**

Adding port forwarding manually is achieved by editing the port
forwarding table shown above. Use the **+** to add a new
row to the table, then click in each cell and type in the required
settings.

Now you are ready to start your |VM|. Select the |VM| in the VirtualBox |VM|
library then click **start**.

A window should open containing a console for your |VM| which should now
be going through its standard boot process. OMERO.server is
automatically started at boot time, meaning you should be able to interact 
with OMERO without further setup.

Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a number of accounts that are preconfigured in the OMERO
virtual appliance. Two of these are |OS| accounts, for logging into the |VM|
as either the **root** user or the **omero** user. There is also a
single OMERO.server account which is used to access the OMERO.server
software as the OMERO.server **root** user.

Virtual Appliance |OS| credentials
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You can use this administrative account to create as many user level
accounts as you require in the usual way.

Working with the OMERO.VM
-------------------------

Now that your |VM| is up and running you have a choice about how to
interact with it.

-  You can connect to OMERO.web from your host browser. Go to
   http://localhost:8080/webclient.
-  You can **use OMERO.clients from within your host OS.** This will
   allow you to import data via a GUI and manage that data once
   imported. To do so, download the :downloads:`OMERO.insight client <>`
   and follow the instructions below. More information can be found
   on our `help website <http://help.openmicroscopy.org>`_
   which provides workflow-based guides to using the OMERO.clients.
-  Alternatively, you can interact with the server command line
   interface by |SSH|'ing into the guest |VM| or by opening a console within
   the |VM| itself. Administrators may need to use one of these methods to
   restart the server and/or change configuration parameters. In this
   case, you must have an |SSH| client installed on your host machine to use 
   to connect to the OMERO.server.

.. note:: 
    The following examples assume that the OMERO |VM| is up and running on the   
    same machine that you are working on.

OMERO.web
^^^^^^^^^

Go directly to http://localhost:8080/webclient to log in with user:
"root" / pw: "omero".

.. note::
    If you receive a 502 nginx error on first attempting to
    connect to the web app on http://localhost:8080/webclient/ please
    restart the virtual machine and try again.

OMERO.insight
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run regular OMERO clients on your host machine and connect to
the server in the |VM|. Our example uses OMERO.insight running on Mac OS X
to connect to the |VM|.

-  :downloads:`Download <>` and 
   :doc:`install <client-tutorials/insight/getting-started>` OMERO.insight
-  Start OMERO.insight
-  Click the spanner icon situated above the password box to
   enter the server settings box shown below.

.. figure:: /images/virtual-appliance-7server-addresses.png
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 45%
   :width: 50%
   :alt: Setting OMERO.insight server address and port number

   Setting OMERO.insight server address and port number

-  Use the *+* icon to add a new server entry with the address
   *localhost* and the port *4064* then click apply
-  You can now use the login credentials given above to log into OMERO.insight
   using the login window shown below (user: "root" / pw: "omero").

.. figure:: /images/virtual-appliance-8login.png
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 45%
   :width: 50%
   :alt: OMERO.insight login window

   OMERO.insight login window

-  OMERO.insight should now load up and display the main window.

You can now use OMERO.insight to import and manage images on a locally running
virtual server just like you would use the standard remote server.

.. note:: A Getting Started guide is available for OMERO.insight on our 
    `help website <http://help.openmicroscopy.org>`_ if you need further 
    assistance to download and install the software.

Secure Shell
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can log into your |VM| using |SSH|, allowing you to use the 
:doc:`command-line-interface`. 
In the following example, we assume that you have an |SSH| client installed
on your host machine and also that your |VM| is up and running.

You can log into the |VM| using the above credentials and the following
command typed into a terminal:

::

    $ ssh omero@localhost -p 2222

This invokes the |SSH| program telling it to login to the localhost on
port 2222 using the username *omero*. Remember that earlier you set up
port forwarding to forward port 2222 on the host machine to port 22 (the
default |SSH| port) on the guest |VM|. You should be prompted
for a password. Once you have successfully entered your password, you
should be greeted by a prompt similar to the following:

::

    omero@omerovm:~$

There are two potential complications to this method, (1) if you have
used a |VM| before then there could be old |SSH| fingerprints set up, (2)
the first time that you log into the |VM| you will be asked to confirm
that you wish to continue connecting. If you get the following message after
you invoke SSH:

::

    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
    @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
    IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
    Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
    It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
    The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
    60:e0:d2:e8:fb:25:bf:09:53:9d:9d:59:59:45:cf:aa.
    Please contact your system administrator.
    Add correct host key in /Users/rleigh/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
    Offending key in /Users/rleigh/.ssh/known_hosts:14
    RSA host key for localhost has changed and you have requested strict checking.
    Host key verification failed.

then you can remove the old fingerprints with the following command
typed into the terminal:

::

    $ ssh-keygen -R [localhost]:2222 -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts

This should produce output similar to:

::

    $ ssh-keygen -R [localhost]:2222 -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts 
    /Users/rleigh/.ssh/known_hosts updated.
    Original contents retained as /Users/rleigh/.ssh/known_hosts.old

The first time that you log into the |VM| you will also be asked to
confirm that you wish to connect to this machine by a message similar to
the following:

::

    $ ssh omero@localhost -p 2222
    The authenticity of host '[localhost]:2222 ([127.0.0.1]:2222)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 60:e0:d2:e8:fb:25:bf:09:53:9d:9d:59:59:45:cf:aa.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

You should confirm that you wish to continue connecting, after which you
will be prompted for your password as usual:

::

    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:2222' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    omero@localhost's password:

After which, you should have a prompt indicating
that you have a shell open and logged into the |VM|:

::

    omero@localhost's password: 
    Linux omerovm 2.6.32-5-686 #1 SMP Mon Jun 11 17:24:18 UTC 2012 i686

Log into the |VM| directly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    Due to the frequent changes in the VirtualBox Guest
    Additions, key mappings between the host and guest |OS| do not always
    work. We recommend using |SSH| as the primary way of interacting with
    the Virtual Appliance CLI.

When you start your |VM| using the VirtualBox GUI, as outlined above, a
window will be displayed showing the boot process for the machine as it
starts up, just like with a real piece of hardware. Once the boot
process has finished you will see a prompt displayed in this window like
so:

::

    [System startup messages]

    Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 omerovm tty1

    omerovm login: _

You can log into the console of the |VM| directly using the user account
credentials above.

::

    omerovm login: omero
    Password: _

There is no GUI on the current OMERO virtual appliance so you will have
to use the Bash shell which looks like this:

::

    omero@omerovm:~$ _

From here you can interact with OMERO.server via the 
:doc:`command-line-interface`. You will need to login as the 'omero' user to 
access the OMERO CLI (user: "omero" / pw: "omero"). Logout using Ctrl-D.

Known issues
------------

Networking not working
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occasionally, during the boot process, the VirtualBox DHCP server fails
to allocate an IP address to the |OS| in the guest |VM|. This means that
OMERO.clients, such as OMERO.insight, cannot connect to the OMERO.server
in the |VM|.

-  **CAUSE:** We believe that this is an intermittent VirtualBox
   bug that resurfaces across many versions `VirtualBox
   #4038 <https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/4038>`_ and previously
   `VirtualBox #3655 <https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/3655>`_

-  **DIAGNOSIS:** Check whether the guest |VM| has been allocated
   the reserved host-only NAT IP address. If 10.0.2.15 does not appear
   in the output from ``ifconfig`` then this issue has occurred. The easiest
   way to verify this is to log into the guest |VM| console and check the
   output from executing the following command:

   ::

       $ ifconfig

-  **SOLUTION:** An easy, but unreliable, fix is to reboot the
   guest |VM|. The preferred fix is to log into the guest |VM| console and
   execute the following commands, which will cause the guest |OS| to
   release its IP lease before requesting a new lease:

   ::

       $ dhclient -r
       $ dhclient -eth0

Port conflict when OMERO.server already running in Host OS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are already running an instance of the OMERO.server in your host
|OS| then there will be a conflict due to the ports assigned to VirtualBox
port-forwarding already being in use.

-  **SOLUTION 1:** Turn off the OMERO.server in the host
   environment by issuing the following command:

   ::

       $ omero admin stop

-  **SOLUTION 2:** Alter the port-forwarding settings for your
   OMERO.VM as described in the :ref:`virtualappliance_portforwarding`
   section. For example, increment the host port settings for omero-ssl,
   omero-unsec, and omero-web. 

   .. note:: 

	   We are assuming that your host |OS| is
	   not already running services on those ports. You can check whether
	   something is already listening on any of these ports by running the
	   following commands (Mac OS X) which should return the prompt without
	   any further output if there is nothing listening:

	   ::

	       $ lsof -nP | grep -E '(:4063)|(:4064)'

|VM| will not boot because the |HDD| is full
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you fill the virtual |HDD| used by your |VM| then the |OS| may be unable to 
boot and you will lose access to your OMERO.server install. You may also get 
a "error 28: no space left on device" message. 
To log into your |VM| you will need to use the recovery mode. Start the |VM| 
and at the Grub screen, use the down arrow followed by return to select the 
recovery mode entry, e.g.

::

        Debian GNU/Linux, with Linux 2.6.32-5-686 (recovery mode)

as seen in this screenshot:

.. figure:: /images/virtual-appliance-cli-recovery-console.png
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 65%
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Recovery console

   Recovery console


Do not worry if your |VM| has a kernel number different to 2.6.32-5-686,
the important thing is that you select the entry labeled "recovery
mode". At this point, the |VM| should rapidly boot into the recovery mode
and enable you to log in using the root password *swordfish*.

Once you have logged in, you have a number of options but the recommended 
courses of action are:

1. Delete unnecessary files using standard Linux command line tools like
   *rm* to make space for the |VM| to boot normally, then use your favored
   OMERO client to login and delete more files. A useful place to start
   might be by deleting the logs stored in /var/logs.
2. Increase the size of your virtual |HDD|. If you have filled your
   existing |HDD| then it is likely that the volume of data you are
   storing is too big for the default |HDD|. You should follow the 
   instructions in the :ref:`increasing-hd-size` section to ensure that the 
   size of virtual |HDD| you have available is suitable for the volumes of
   data that you are collecting.

.. _increasing-hd-size:

Increasing HD size 
------------------

Image data can become very large
and easily fill available hard-drive space. By default, the OMERO virtual
appliance is supplied with a 30GB virtual hard-drive. Before using the
appliance, consider the volume of data you will be working with whilst 
evaluating OMERO and whether you need to increase the size of the virtual 
hard-drive to accommodate it. 

The following is a step-by-step guide; be aware that this is not a risk-free 
procedure and you should backup your |VM| before proceeding.

Preliminary steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Acquiring a Ubuntu Linux ISO
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Download an `Ubuntu Linux ISO <http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop>`_. The
most up-to-date version is fine.

Backing up your |VM|
""""""""""""""""""""

Before you proceed further, you should create a clone of the omero-vm and 
subsequently work on the copy so that if something gets broken you can always 
start again. The easiest way to do this is from the command line. 

.. note:: 
    If you are on Windows then you should navigate to :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\` because the VBoxManage tools are not added
    to your path by default. 

Start a shell and, assuming that your |VM| has the default name of
omero-vm, use the following command:

::

    $ VBoxManage clonevm omero-vm --mode machine --options keepallmacs --name omero-vm-2 --register

This will create a copy of your |VM| called omero-vm-2 which you can make
alterations to. This means that you can always return to the original
omero-vm if you break anything. From now on **only** make changes to
omero-vm-2.

Extending the |HDD|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, your virtual hard-drive attached to omero-vm-2 is of a type
which cannot be extended; so you need to change this by cloning your HDD
from the VDMK type to VDI type:

::

    $ VBoxManage clonehd omero-vm-2-disk1.vmdk omero-vm-2-disk1.vdi --format VDI

You now need to increase the size of your virtual |HDD|. The following
command resizes the |HDD| to 60GB but you should select a size to
suit the amount of data you plan to store in OMERO:

::

    $ VBoxManage modifyhd omero-vm-2-disk1.vdi --resize 60000

Adding the extended |HDD| to the |VM| clone
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You now need to tell VirtualBox to use :file:`omero-vm-2-disk1.vdi`
instead of :file:`omero-vm-2-disk1.vmdk` which is currently attached to
the |VM|. Whilst you are on the :guilabel:`Storage` tab you will also attach 
the Ubuntu ISO that you downloaded earlier to your |VM|. This will allow you 
to use the tools that ship with Ubuntu to make changes to the filesystem 
within your |VM|.

#. Start VirtualBox and select omero-vm-2 in the |VM| library.
#. Right-click :menuselection:`Settings` then select the :guilabel:`Storage`
   tab.
#. Right-click on :guilabel:`omero-vm-2-disk1.vmdk` and select
   :menuselection:`Remove attachment`.
#. Next to the :guilabel:`SATA Controller` entry, click the
   :guilabel:`Add Hard Disk` icon with a green plus sign. In the pop-up
   dialog, select :guilabel:`Choose existing disk`. Now navigate to the
   location where VirtualBox stores your virtual machines and enter the
   :file:`omero-vm-2` directory. Select the :file:`omero-vm-2 disk1.vdi` and
   click :menuselection:`open`.
#. Add an :menuselection:`IDE Controller` using the
   :menuselection:`Add  Controller` icon. Select this new controller
   then click :menuselection:`Add CD/DVD device` followed by
   :menuselection:`Choose Disk`. Navigate to the location of your Ubuntu
   ISO, select it and click :menuselection:`OK`.

The storage for your OMERO |VM| should now look similar to :ref:`va-hdd-step01`.

.. _va-hdd-step01:
.. figure:: /images/va-hdd-step01.png
    :width: 60%
    :align: center
    :alt: Virtual Appliance storage settings
    
    Virtual Appliance storage settings

Click :guilabel:`OK` to return to the VirtualBox |VM| library. With omero-vm-2
selected, ensure that the storage details match what you expect, e.g.
omero-vm-2-disk1.vdi is connected to your SATA Port 0. The size for this
disk should also more or less match what you specified earlier with the
`VBoxManage modifyhd` command. The reported numbers do not exactly
matchup, e.g. a virtualised |HDD| of 60GB size will be reported as 58.59GB.

Reallocating space on the VA |HDD|
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Start the omero-vm-2 |VM|. Ubuntu linux should boot and you should
eventually see a welcome screen giving you the option to try or to install
Ubuntu. You can now start the GParted software and resize your partitions.

#. Select try Ubuntu and you should be presented with a graphical desktop.
#. Start the `gparted` tool using the menu option under :menuselection:`System --> Administration --> GParted Partition Editor`.
#. The GParted GUI will display information similar to :ref:`va-hdd-step02`.
#. Right-click the entry for :guilabel:`/dev/sda5` and select
   :guilabel:`Swapoff`.
#. Right click on :guilabel:`/dev/sda5` and click :guilabel:`Delete` to remove
   the swap partition.
#. Delete :guilabel:`/dev/sda2` in the same way. This should leave two
   entries, one for :guilabel:`/dev/sda1` and one for unallocated space.
#. Right-click :guilabel:`/dev/sda1` and select :guilabel:`Resize`. Now drag
   the right arrow to the right until the entry for :guilabel:`Free space following (MiB)` is about 2000, then click :guilabel:`Resize/Move`.
#. Right click the entry for unallocated space and select :guilabel:`New` from
   the pop-up menu. Select :guilabel:`linux-swap` from the :guilabel:`File system` drop-down menu then :guilabel:`Add`.

   Virtual Appliance |HDD| in GParted

Up until this point you have not actually applied any of your changes to the 
|HDD|, you have only specified a list of changes that should be made. You can 
now go ahead and apply them by selecting the :menuselection:`Edit --> Apply 
All Operations` menu item, then clicking :guilabel:`Apply` in the confirmation
dialog box.

When the operations have completed, dismiss the dialog with the
:guilabel:`Close` button, close GParted, then shutdown the |VM|.

Changing |HDD| settings inside the VA
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You no longer need the Ubuntu ISO so you can detach it from your |VM|. Ensure 
that omero-vm-2 is selected then click :guilabel:`Settings` and select the
:guilabel:`Storage` tab. Right-click the :guilabel:`IDE Controller` entry and
select :guilabel:`Remove Controller`, then click :guilabel:`OK` to return the
VirtualBox |VM| library.

Start the omero-vm-2 |VM| and allow it to boot. Log in as root then issue the
``df -h`` command. Verify that the size of the `/dev/sda1` is approximately 
what you expect, e.g. if you allocated a 60GB virtual |HDD| then after size
conversions and swap allocation you should end up with `/dev/sda1` reported as
being around 56GB.

Within the |VM| you need to add the UUID of the new swap partition to the
:file:`/etc/fstab` file because you deleted the old one and created a new swap 
meaning that the IDs will no longer match.

::

    $ vim /etc/fstab

Move your cursor to the entry that looks similar to the following:

::

    UUID=SOME-LONG-ALPHA-NUMERIC-STRING none swap sw 0 0

then press :kbd:`i` to enter "insert mode". Delete the alphanumeric string
so that the entry looks similar to the following:

::

    UUID= none swap sw 0 0

and place your cursor after the equals sign. You can now issue a command
from within the VIM editor to insert your new swap UUID into the :file:`fstab`
file.

::

    [Insert Mode] <CTRL-R> =system('/sbin/blkid -t TYPE=swap | cut -c18-53') <return>

Save your file and quit VIM:

::

    [Command Mode] :wq <return>

Now reboot your |VM| with

::

    $ shutdown -r now

Once your |VM| has rebooted you should now have a working |VM| with a larger
virtual |HDD|.
