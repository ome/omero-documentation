About the OMERO Platform
########################

************
Introduction
************

OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a modern client-server software platform
for visualizing, managing, and annotating scientific image data. OMERO
lets you import and archive your images, annotate and tag them, record 
your experimental protocols, and export images in a number of formats. It also 
allows you to collaborate with colleagues anywhere in the world by creating 
user groups with different permission levels. OMERO consists of a Java server,
several Java client applications, as well as Python and C++ bindings
and a Django-based web application.

The OMERO clients are cross-platform. To run on your computer they require
Java 1.6 or higher to be installed. This can easily be installed from
http://java.com/en if it is not already included in your OS. The OMERO.insight 
client gets all of its information from a remote OMERO.server â€” the location 
of which is specified at login. Since this connection utilises a standard 
network connection, the client can be run anytime the user is connected to the 
internet.

-   There are a number of demonstration videos available on the
    :omero_plone:`Features List <feature-list>` page, providing an
    overview of the applications.

-   You can also browse our :omero_plone:`screenshots <screenshots>`. 

-   As OMERO is an open source project with developers and users in many 
    countries, :doc:`connecting to the community <community-resources>` can 
    provide you with a wealth of experience to draw on for help and advice.

-   ***NEW*** Our partners within the OME consortium are working on 
    integrating additional functions and modules with OMERO. See the 
    :partner_plone:`Partner Projects <>` page for details of the latest 
    extensions which could help OMERO meet your research needs more fully.

-   ***NEW*** You can also extend the functionality of OMERO using 
    OMERO.scripts, our version of plugins. Guides to some of the scripts which 
    ship with OMERO releases are already provided, but you can also check out 
    our :community_plone:`Script Sharing <scripts>` page to find extra ones.

-   ***NEW*** Workflow-based user assistance guides are provided on our
    :help:`help website <>`. Extended OMERO.web and guides to other OMERO 
    applications will be coming here soon.

Quickstart for users
********************

If your institution does not have an existing OMERO.server for you to connect 
to, you can apply for a user account on our demo server, or create your own 
using a virtual appliance (a step-by-step guide for how to do this is 
provided).
