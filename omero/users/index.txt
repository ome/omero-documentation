Introduction

OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a modern client-server software platform
for visualizing, managing, and annotating scientific image data. OMERO
lets you import and archive your images, annotate and tag them, record 
your experimental protocols, and export images in a number of formats. It also 
allows you to collaborate with colleagues anywhere in the world by creating 
user groups with different permission levels. OMERO consists of a Java server,
several Java client applications, as well as Python and C++ bindings
and a Django-based web application.

The OMERO clients are cross-platform. To run on your computer they require
Java 1.5 or higher to be installed. This can easily be installed from
http://java.com/en if it is not already included in your OS. The OMERO.insight 
client gets all of its information from a remote OMERO.server — the location 
of which is specified at login. Since this connection utilises a standard 
network connection, the client can be run anytime the user is connected to the 
internet.

    :alt: The OMERO Platform

This documentation is for the new OMERO 5 Platform. This version is designed 
to improve our handling of complex multidimensional datasets. It allows you to 
upload your files in their original format, preserving file names and any 
nested directory structure in the server repository. It should 
currently be considered **beta quality**, see the 
:omero_plone:`OME 5 overview <>` for further details. For more technical 
information, please refer to the :doc:`/developers/index`.

-   **Coming soon** - demonstration videos on the
    :omero_plone:`Features List <feature-list>` page, providing an
    overview of the applications.

Quickstart
**********

If your institution does not have an existing OMERO.server for you to connect 
to, you can create your own using a virtual appliance (a step-by-step guide 
for how to do this is provided). The Demo server service is currently only 
available to try out the latest release of OMERO 4.4. OMERO 5 demo accounts 
will made available in due course.
