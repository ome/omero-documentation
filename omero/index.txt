OMERO |release| Documentation
#############################

The OMERO |release| documentation is divided into three parts. The 
:doc:`users/index` covers the basic usage of OMERO as well as training 
material suitable for most end-users. System administrators wanting to install 
an OMERO server will be more interested by the :doc:`sysadmins/index` and 
subsequent sections. Finally, developers can find more specific information 
about OMERO in the :doc:`developers/index`.
