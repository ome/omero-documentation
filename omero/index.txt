The OMERO |release| documentation is divided into three parts:

:doc:`users/index` introduces the user-facing client applications and how to
get started, details the CLI client, and indicates where users can access
further help and support.

System administrators wanting to install and manage an OMERO server can find
instructions in the :doc:`sysadmins/index`.

Developers can find more specific and technical information about OMERO in the
:doc:`developers/index`.
