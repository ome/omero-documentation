The OMERO |release| documentation is divided into three parts. The 
:doc:`users/index` introduces the user-facing client applications and how to 
get started, as well as detailing where users can access further help and 
support. System administrators wanting to install an OMERO server can find 
instructions in the :doc:`sysadmins/index`. Finally, developers can find more 
specific and technical information about OMERO in the :doc:`developers/index`.
