Summary of changes for OMERO 5.5 and provisional changes for 5.6
================================================================

Criteria for what is considered to be supportable includes whether
support by both upstream developers and operating system distributions
will be available for the lifetime of the |version| release (including
security support), and also upon our resources allocated to CI and
testing. If we are not actively testing it, we **cannot** claim it is
supported or functional. Software components must be provided and
supported either by an operating system distribution or their original
developers.

This section contains a summary of the changes made to the minimum
version requirements for the current (|version|) release and also
**possible** changes for the next release, albeit **tentatively at this
point**. The intent is to provide a roadmap in order that sysadmins may
plan ahead and ensure that prerequisites are in place ahead of time to
ease future upgrades. The following sections provide more detailed
information and the rationale for the changes.

Please check the meaning of the various :ref:`symbols <support-levels>` used
on this page. Any system/component with a green tick symbol is supported.

Operating systems
-----------------

* Microsoft Windows

  * Client support only.
  * Rationale: see `blog post explanation <https://blog.openmicroscopy.org/tech-issues/future-plans/deployment/2016/03/22/windows-support/>`_

* MacOS X

  * MacOS X is typically suited only to client use, not serious server
    deployment, although the server can be expected to build on versions with
    current security support for development purposes.

* Linux distribution CentOS/RHEL

  * Only LTS versions are supported and tested. Non-LTS versions
    following a supported LTS release are likely to work but are not
    officially supported or tested.
  * Rationale: No change in this timeframe.

Bitness
-------

  * Rationale: OMERO is tested on 64-bit systems only.

Components
----------

       - |Upcoming|
       - |Upcoming|
       - |Recommended|

  * Rationale: Current releases available for all supported systems
    from upstream and for CentOS/RHEL officially via SCL (software
    collections).

* Python

  .. list-table::
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Python
         - OMERO.web 5.4
         - OMERO.server 5.4
         - OMERO 5.5
         - OMERO 5.6

         - |Broken|
         - |Broken|
         - |Broken|
         - |Recommended|

  * Rationale: 2.7 is provided by all systems except for CentOS/RHEL
    6.x, however it is available officially via SCL.

* Ice

  .. list-table::
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Ice
         - OMERO 5.4
         - OMERO 5.5
         - OMERO 5.6
       * - 3.5
         - |Deprecated|
         - |Dropped|
         - |Dropped|

         - |Recommended|
         - |Recommended|
         - |Recommended|
       * - 3.7
         - |Unsupported|
         - |Unsupported|
         - |Unsupported|

  * Rationale: Ice releases often include breaking changes and Ice 3.7
    requires substantial changes to OMERO. To avoid future maintenance
    burden OME's effort is better invested in migrating away from Ice
    completely.

* Java

  .. list-table::
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Java
         - OMERO 5.4
         - OMERO 5.5
         - OMERO 5.6
       * - 7
         - |Deprecated|

       * - 11
         - |Unsupported|
         - |Upcoming|
         - |Recommended|

  * Rationale: For OMERO 5.4 deprecate Java 7 because security support ended
    in April 2015. MATLAB ships with Java 8 since R2017b.

.. warning::

   *Only* OpenJDK is supported from OMERO 5.5. OME no longer tests Oracle
   Java due to `licensing changes
   <https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/oracle-jdk-faqs.html>`__.

Support levels
==============

The following table defines the symbols used throughout this page to
describe the support status of a given component, as it progresses

      - unsupported/misc
      - Not supported for some reason other than the above

Operating system support
========================

The following subsections detail the versions of each operating system
which are supported by both its upstream developers (for security and
general updates) and by OME for OMERO building and server deployment.

UNIX (FreeBSD)
--------------

It only really makes sense to support the base toolchain for major
releases and the Ports tree (which is continually updated); these will
be covered in the dependencies, below.

Linux (CentOS and RHEL)

RHEL/CentOS 7 is supported at present. Given the long life
of enterprise releases, we intend to support only the latest release
at any given time or else it ties us into very old dependencies.

Linux (Ubuntu)
--------------

      - |Recommended|

Only the LTS releases are supported due to resource limitations upon
CI and testing. Only the last two LTS releases are supported (being a
bit more frequent than CentOS/RHEL). There is currently no CI testing
for any version.


Dependencies
============

The following subsections detail the versions of each dependency
needed by OMERO which are supported by both its upstream developers
(for security and general updates) and by OME for OMERO building and
server and client deployment.

.. note::
    Versions in brackets are in development distributions and may
    change without notice.

At the moment 2.7 support is present upstream until 2020;
3.x versions continue to be released and retired regularly in
parallel. The limiting factor will be distribution support for 2.7 as
major packages are slowly switching to 3.x and this might cause
problems if our python module dependencies are no longer available
without major effort.

The supported version of the Django module used by OMERO.web (1.8)
requires Python 2.7. The older version (1.6) will work with Python
2.6 but lacks security support so should *not* be used.
