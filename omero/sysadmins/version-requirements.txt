Summary of changes for OMERO 5.1 and planned changes for 5.2
============================================================

Criteria for what is considered to be supportable includes whether
support by both upstream developers and operating system distributions
will be available for the lifetime of the 5.1 release (including
security support), and also upon our resources allocated to CI and
testing. If we are not actively testing it, we cannot claim it is
supported or functional.  Software components must be provided and
supported either by an operating system distribution or their original
developers.

This section contains a summary of the changes made to the minimum
version requirements for the 5.1 release and also planned changes for
the following 5.2 release, albeit tentatively at this point.  The
intent is to provide a roadmap in order that sysadmins may plan ahead
and ensure that prerequisites are in place ahead of time to ease
future upgrades.  The following sections provide more detailed
information and the rationale for the changes.

Operating systems
-----------------

* Microsoft Windows

  * [5.1] XP/Server 2003/Vista dropped, 7 (client) recommended /
    Server 2008R2 (server) recommended
  * [5.2] 7 / Server 2008R2 supported, 8 (client) recommended / Server
    2012R2 (server) recommended
  * Rationale: All prior versions prior to this are/will be out of
    support shortly except Vista (which we do not test and is not
    widely used). We have no testing of these older systems.

* MacOS X

  * [5.1] 10.6 and 10.7 dropped, 10.8 supported, 10.9 recommended,
    10.10 supported
  * [5.2] 10.8 deprecated, 10.9 supported, 10.10 recommended
  * Support 10.8 for client only, test server only on 10.9/10.10 (for
    5.1); test server only on 10.10+ for 5.2.
  * Rationale: 10.6 and 10.7 no longer have security support and it
    still leaves 3 versions to support. MacOS X is typically suited
    only to client use, not serious server deployment, so limit
    testing accordingly

* Linux (CentOS/RHEL)

  * [5.1] 6.x recommended, 7.x supported
  * [5.2] 7.x recommended, 6.x deprecated/dropped
  * Rationale: 7 is quite new and not yet widely adopted, and so it is
    likely many institutions will wish to continue using 6 for the
    foreseeable future. However, the versions in 6 are getting quite
    old and this does affect the support for other components (see
    below); schedule its deprecation/dropping in 5.2 depending upon
    the circumstances

* Linux (Ubuntu LTS)

  * [5.1] 10.04 dropped, 12.04 deprecated, 14.04 recommended
  * [5.2] 12.04 dropped, 14.04 recommended
  * Only LTS versions are supported and tested. Non-LTS versions
    following a supported LTS release are likely to work but are not
    officially supported or tested.
  * Rationale: Both are newer than CentOS/RHEL 6.x, so both could be
    supported since all version requirements are satisfied. However,
    14.04 comes with Ice 3.5 and is generally more up to date, and we
    do not have testing in place for either at present. We do not have
    the resources to test non-LTS versions, though recent releases are
    in use by developers.

* Linux (Debian)

  * [5.1] 6 deprecated, 7 recommended
  * [5.2] 7 deprecated, 8 recommended
  * Rationale: 6 is older than Ubuntu 12.04 and only has Ice 3.3;
    extended support will be present for the 5.1 lifetime however so
    will be usable if Ice is upgraded, but will not have official
    support.

Bitness
-------

Currently 32- and 64-bit systems are supported for client and server
on all platforms with the exception of MacOS X (64-bit only).

* [5.1] Drop 32-bit support for server, retain 32-bit support for
  clients
* [5.2] Drop 32-bit support for Ice and native code
* Rationale: It’s not practical to run a server on a 32-bit system due
  to its memory requirements, so it’s safe to drop 32-bit support for
  OMERO.server in 5.1 given that it’s de-facto 64-bit-only
  today. There are still a significant number of 32-bit Windows
  clients (~60%), so support should be retained until this changes.
  Maintaining custom builds of Ice for 32-bit systems is extremely
  costly, and so we could consider dropping them for 5.2.

Components
----------

* PostgreSQL

  * [5.1] 8.4/9.0/9.1 dropped, 9.2 deprecated, 9.3+ recommended
  * [5.2] 9.2 dropped, 9.3 deprecated, 9.4+ recommended
  * Rationale: Current releases available for all supported systems
    from upstream and for CentOS/RHEL 6.x officially via SCL (software
    collections). At a bare minimum, 8.4 and 9.0 must be dropped (end
    of security support); dropping 9.1 removes the floating point
    issues fixed by 9.2+. Due to its age, 8.4 no longer receives
    adequate testing and so we can’t claim to support it. The same
    applies to 9.0 and 9.1.  Given the annual release cycle, it would
    make sense to deprecate 9.2 for 5.2.

* Python

  * [5.1] 2.6 deprecated, 2.7 recommended, 3.x not supported
  * [5.2] 2.6 dropped, 2.7 recommended, 3.x not supported
  * Rationale: 2.7 is provided by all systems except for CentOS/RHEL
    6.x, however it is available officially via SCL so could be made
    the minimum. Note that 3.3 is also available via SCL, so there is
    potential for a 3.x migration in the 5.2 timeframe. Dropping 2.6
    would unify python support to a single major version, and remove a
    number of portability issues; now it is restricted to CentOS/RHEL
    6, in practice it is much less tested than 2.7 since no developer
    is using it routinely. Removing 2.6 support will be dependent upon
    internal testing of the SCL python in CentOS.

* GCC

  * [5.1] 4.4 deprecated, 4.6+ supported, 4.8+ recommended
  * [5.2] 4.4 dropped, 4.6+ deprecated, 4.8+ recommended
  * Rationale: 4.4 is the CentOS/RHEL 6.x default. It would be
    desirable to update but is probably not what external users will
    want given the compatibility concerns. The SCL DeveloperToolset3
    could bring this up to GCC 4.9.1, which would make the new
    baseline GCC 4.6 (Ubuntu 12.04 and Travis).  The planned changes
    for 5.2 depend upon our support of CentOS/RHEL 6.x and Ubuntu
    12.04.

* LLVM/clang

  * [5.1] 3.3 dropped, 3.4 recommended, 3.5 supported 
  * [5.2] 3.4 supported, 3.5 recommended
  * Rationale: It is the current toolchain on MacOS/FreeBSD and is
    working well; 3.3 dropped due to no longer being used by current
    toolchains

* Microsoft Visual Studio

  * [5.1] 2010 deprecated, 2012 supported, 2013 recommended
  * [5.2] 2010 dropped, 2012 deprecated, 2013 recommended,
    2015 supported
  * Rationale: The minimum (and maximum) MSVC version is determined by
    the Windows Ice builds provided by ZeroC, and as such is limited
    by our Ice version requirements. Raising the limit in 5.2 will
    permit use of newer language features.

* Ice

  * [5.1] 3.4 deprecated, 3.5 recommended, 3.6 not supported
  * [5.2] 3.4 dropped, 3.5 deprecated, 3.6 recommended
  * Rationale: 3.4 is no longer supported by ZeroC with 3.5 being
    current. By the release of 5.2, Ice 3.6 will have been out for
    some time and should be well tested.

* Java

  * [5.1] 6 deprecated, 7 recommended, 8 supported
  * [5.2] 6 dropped, 7 deprecated, 8 recommended
  * Rationale: It will be 2 years this February since the last Java 6
    security update. Java 7 is supported on all supported operating
    systems above, and in most cases is the default Java version on
    those systems (it is now 8 on some). This was mentioned recently,
    and also by the Fiji developers; 5.1 would be an opportune time to
    deprecate or preferably drop Java 6. Also note that we no longer
    actively test with a Java 6 JVM; all internal testing is on Java 7
    or 8 (Oracle and OpenJDK), and there are some client issues with
    OpenJDK6.  Also note that Ice 3.6 drops Java 6 support.  For 5.2
    deprecate 7; this is because security support ends in April 2015.
  * For MacOS X, separate application bundles for Java 6 and Java 7+
    allow the use of Java 7 or 8 on all supported MacOS X versions.
  * The requirement for 7 in the Windows clients is less urgent, but
    will encourage migration to a non-deprecated Java version ahead of
    the removal of support for 6.

* Apache

  * [5.1] 2.2 supported, 2.4 recommended
  * [5.2] 2.2 deprecated, 2.4 recommended
  * Rationale: 2.2 is the CentOS/RHEL 6.x and Ubuntu 12.04
    version which will be deprecated in 5.2.

* nginx

  * [5.1] 1.0 deprecated, 1.2/1.4 supported, 1.6 recommended
  * [5.2] 1.0 dropped, 1.2/1.4 deprecated, 1.6 recommemded
  * Rationale: All versions work; 1.0 is the Ubuntu 12.04 version, 1.4
    is the Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 8 version.  Deprecate and drop for
    5.2 accordingly.

Support levels

XP is now unsupported upstream, and Server 2003 will be unsupported
within the timeframe of 5.1 support. Vista is likely supported but
usage is minimal and it is untested, hence marked as dropped. 7/Server
2008 and 8/Server 2012 are both supported and used. Server 2008 builds
in place; no 2012 builds or testing in place yet. No regular Windows
CI deployment and testing is in place other than manually. Some manual
testing on Windows 7 VMs and machines.

Apple do not formally announce end of life for their releases, but
10.6 security fixes ended some time back, and 10.7 has now also ended
with the release of 10.10. We have regular CI testing of 10.8, 10.9
and 10.10 builds plus developer testing of building and client and
server deployment. 10.6 and 10.7 are marked as dropped since we no
longer use 10.6 internally, and never used 10.7, and they are no
longer tested by the CI infrastructure (all 10.6 and 10.7 nodes
retired).

UNIX (FreeBSD)
--------------

It only really makes sense to support the base toolchain for major
releases and the Ports tree (which is continually updated); these will
be covered in the dependencies, below.

Linux (Centos and RHEL)

Only RHEL and CentOS 6 are supported at present. Given the long life
of enterprise releases, we intend to support only the latest release
at any given time or else it ties us into very old dependencies; 6.x
is already quite long in the tooth, however is in wide use and so will
require supporting for 5.1 at a minimum. 7.x can be the recommended
version once it is properly tested by us and has appropriate CI
support. There is currently extensive CI support for building and
deployment with CentOS 6 but it is not used directly by developers in
general.

Linux (Fedora)
--------------

`General overview <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Life_Cycle>`__

Due to the fast pace of Fedora development, it only really makes sense
to support the current and perhaps the previous release; these will be
covered in the dependencies, below.

Only the LTS releases are supported due to resource limitations upon
CI and testing. Only the last two LTS releases are supported (being a
bit more frequent than CentOS/RHEL). There is currently no CI testing
for any version, but some developer use of 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS and
more recent non-LTS releases.

Stable releases 7.x and 6.x are supported. There is no CI testing for
any version, and some developer use of 7.x.

Linux (Debian testing and unstable)
-----------------------------------

Due to the fast pace of Debian developement, it only really makes
sense to support the last one or two stable releases; the testing and
unstable requirements will be covered in the dependencies, below.

Hardware support
================


Microsoft Windows
-----------------

Supports amd64 (64-bit) and i386 / x86 (32-bit) for all supported
versions; most systems are today running x64 with most hardware being
x64, but there is still a niche of x86 users, estimated <25% and
falling globally.  On Windows, crude estimates are that OMERO.server
is 66% amd64, OMERO.insight is 40% amd64, Bio-Formats is 70% amd64.
However, note that OMERO.server deployment on Windows is rare, and the
i386 systems are not likely to be production servers.

Unix (MacOS X)
--------------

Currently all supported versions are amd64 (64-bit) only.

Unix (FreeBSD)
--------------

Supports amd64 (64-bit) and i386 / x86 (32-bit) for all supported
releases. Other platforms are supported, but may require manual
building of prerequisites.

Linux (RHEL and CentOS)
-----------------------

Version 6 supports amd64 (64-bit) and i386 / x86 (32-bit). Version 7
supports amd64 (64-bit) only.  Crude estimates (Linux+MacOS) are that
OMERO.server is 98% amd64, OMERO.insight is 98% amd64, Bio-Formats is
78% amd64.

Linux (other)
-------------

Most distributions support i386 / x86 (32-bit) as well, while some
support additional architectures such as 32-bit and/or 64-bit arm and
powerpc.

Additional notes
----------------

The OMERO server is 64-bit-only due to the large memory requirements.
On the client side, there is a requirement for 32-bit support for
Windows clients and to a lesser extent on Linux, and zero on MacOS X
at present. Dropping 32-bit support for OMERO.server and C++ Ice and
other builds should be considered, given the vast reduction in the
support burden and steadily dropping need for these builds.

Dependencies
============

The following subsections detail the versions of each dependency
needed by OMERO which are supported by both its upstream developers
(for security and general updates) and by OME for OMERO building and
server and client deployment.

.. note::
    Versions in brackets are in development distributions and may
    change without notice.

The PostgreSQL project provides `packages

Therefore distribution support is not critical since 9.3 and 9.4 are
available for all platforms.

At the moment 2.7 support is present upstream for the foreseeable
future; 3.x versions continue to be released and retired regularly in
parallel. The limiting factor will be distribution support for 2.7 as
major packages are slowly switching to 3.x, and this might cause
problems if our python module dependencies are no longer available
without major effort. Ice in particular has dropped 2.7 support for
Windows, and has a significant cost in providing custom rebuilds.

Note that clang++ 3.3 is used in MacOS 10.8 and FreeBSD 10; earlier
versions were not much used as a default compiler and are probably not
worth supporting; 3.4 is used in MacOS X 10.9 and 10.10 and in FreeBSD
10.1. Until 3.4, no point releases were made for major versions.

The version to use is largely dependent upon the Ice support for a particular Visual Studio version.

- Ice 3.6 supports 2013 and 2012
- Ice 3.5 supports 2013, 2012 and 2010
- Ice 3.4 supports 2010 and 2008

In general later versions have better C++ standards conformance and
correctness, and should be preferred where possible.

Note that all distributions provide OpenJDK 6, 7 and/or 8 due to
distribution restrictions by Oracle. Oracle Java may be used if
downloaded separately.

Oracle no longer allow general downloading of Java 6. Java 7 is
available for all platforms except for OSX 10.6 (where it is
installable manually by unpacking the 10.7 installer). Some 1.8
OpenJDK versions are broken (Debian/Ubuntu 1.8.0u40 broken), but some
work (1.8.0u25, FreeBSD). 1.8 should become recommended once working
versions exist in all distributions.

  Driver/hardware dependent, but the Windows Vista/7/8 DirectX 9
  requirement is mostly the same as OpenGL 2.0, so any badged machine
  should have OpenGL 2.0-capable hardware (it will also require a
  functional driver)

†
  Driver/hardware dependent

Support is largely down to the system hardware (GPU) and drivers.
There are no guarantees for 2.0 and greater on Windows (1.4 only
guaranteed), but AMD, Intel and nVidia all provide GL drivers
supporting newer versions. The minimum baseline is probably 2.1.
However, 3.2/3.3 is probably the baseline for most hardware under 5
years old, with 4.x being the typical baseline for hardware from a
year ago.
