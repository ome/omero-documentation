OMERO.fs: DropBox
=================

OMERO.fs is planned as a system of services for accessing image data on
server filesystems from the OMERO.server without the need to
import the pixel data into the server. The underlying OMERO.fs servers
are file system monitors which notify interested OMERO.fs clients of
newly created, modified or deleted files in a particular part of a file
system.

As of 4.2, the FS services do **not** prevent the data duplication issue
which has often been discussed, but instead provides a background
client, "DropBox", which can automatically import data into OMERO.

Prerequisites
-------------

-   OMERO.fs has the following general requirements:

    -   **Ice 3.3**
    -  **Python 2.4 or above**

-   OMERO.fs is built on underlying OS file-notification system, and so
    is only available for specific versions of certain operating systems.
    OMERO.fs will currently function on the following systems:

    -   Linux with kernel 2.6.13 and higher.
    -   Mac OS 10.5 and above.
    -   Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

-   In addition some platforms require further Python packages to be
    available:

    -   Linux servers 4.2.x or earlier require `Pyinotify
        0.7.x <http://pyinotify.sourceforge.net/>`_ or `Pyinotify
        0.8.x <http://trac.dbzteam.org/pyinotify/>`_. Some Linux
        distributions have one or other of these packages pre-installed.
        Some distributions of Pyinotify versions 0.8.6 and 0.8.7 are not
        compatible with Python 2.4. If your system runs Python 2.4
        Pyinotify 0.8.5 or lower is recommended.
    -   Linux systems running Python 2.4 also requires ctypes (bundled
        with Python 2.5+) which is available from
        `http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/ <http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/>`_
    -   Mac OS systems that use a macports install of Python will need to
        have FSEvents available in the PYTHONPATH. This will require a
        path of the form
        ``/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.X/Extras/lib/python/PyObjC/``
        to be added, according to the version of Python used.

-   The filesystem which OMERO.fs watches must be local to the given
    operating system. Watching a network-attached share (NAS) is strictly
    ***not*** supported.

.. _dropbox:

OMERO DropBox
-------------

The first application of OMERO.fs is OMERO.dropbox which utilises a file
system monitor to find newly uploaded files and run a fully automatic
import on those files if possible. This release of OMERO.dropbox runs on
the same machine as the OMERO.server and watches designated areas of the
local filesystem for new or modified files. If those files are
importable, then an automatic import is initiated. OMERO.dropbox is
started automatically when the OMERO.server starts and it will run if
the above prerequisites are met.

Using DropBox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In its default configuration the monitored area of the file system is a
``DropBox`` subdirectory of the OmeroBinaryRepository directory. The
system administrator should create ``DropBox`` and then under that a
directory for each user, using their omero username. The ownership and
permissions should be set so that a user can copy files into their
DropBox directory:

::

    /OMERO/DropBox/amy
                  /emily
                  /edgar
                  /root
                  /zak

Experimenters can add subdirectories under their named directory for
convenience. Copying or moving a file of an importable file type into a
named directory or nested subdirectory will initiate an automatic import
of that file for that user. Multi-file formats will be imported after
the last required file of a set is copied into the directory.

Acquisition systems can then be configured to drop a user's images into
a given DropBox.

.. note:: 
    The DropBox system is designed for images filesets to be copied in at 
    normal acquisition rates. Copying numbers of files en masse may result in 
    files failing to import.

Log files
~~~~~~~~~

The log files ``var/logs/FSServer.log`` and ``var/logs/DropBox.log``
will indicate success or otherwise of start-up of the two components.
Once running, ``var/logs/FSServer.log`` will log file events seen within
designated file areas and ``var/logs/DropBox.log`` will log the progress
of any file imports.

Advanced use
~~~~~~~~~~~~

OMERO.dropbox can be configured in several ways through
``etc/grid/templates.xml``. In its default configuration, as detailed
above, it monitors the subdirectory ``DropBox`` of the OMERO data
directory for all users.

A number of the properties in ``templates.xml`` accept a semi-colon
separated list of values. This extended configuration allows a site to
watch multiple directories, and configure each for a different user, a
different type of file, etc. Any value missing from the configuration
(e.g. ``value="1;;2"``) will be replaced by the default value.

One example alternative configuration would be to watch specific
directories for specific users. In the example below two directories are
monitored, one for user ``amy`` and one for ``zak``:

::

    <property name="omero.fs.importUsers"  value="amy;zak"/>
    <property name="omero.fs.watchDir"  value="/home/amy/myData;/home/zak/work/data"/>

The remaining properties have been left at their default values for both
users.

To limit DropBox to import only files belonging to specific image types
the following property can be set,

::

    <property name="omero.fs.readers"  value="/home/amy/my_readers.txt;"/>

Here only the image types listed in ``my_readers.txt`` will be imported
for the user ``amy`` while the system-wide ``readers.txt`` will be used
for ``zak``.

For a full description of the properties see below.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

Each property takes the form of a single item or a semi-colon separated
list of items. Where the item is a list, values within that list should
be comma separated.

-   importUsers

    The importUsers is either ``default`` for the standard DropBox
    configuration or a list of OMERO user names. The default is default.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.importUsers"  value="default"/>


-   watchDir

    The absolute directory path of interest for each user. The default is
    empty.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.watchDir"  value=""/>

-   eventTypes

    For automatic import Creation and Modification events are monitored. It
    is also possible to monitor Deletion events though these are not used by
    DropBox. The default is Creation,Modification.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.eventTypes"  value="Creation,Modification"/>

-   pathMode

    By default existing and newly created subdirectories are monitored. It
    is possible to restrict monitoring to a single directory ("Flat"), only
    existing subdirectories ("Recurse"), or all subdirectories ("Follow").
    For DropBox to function correctly the mode should be Follow. The default
    is Follow.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.pathMode"  value="Follow"/>

-   whitelist

    A list of file extensions of interest. An empty list implies all file
    extensions are monitored. The default is an empty list.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.whitelist"  value=""/>

-   blacklist

    A list of subdirectories to ignore. Not currently supported.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.blacklist"  value=""/>

-   timeout

    This timeout in seconds is used by one-shot monitors. This property is
    not used by DropBox.

    ::

        property name="omero.fs.timeout"  value="0.0"/>

-   blockSize

    The number of events that should be propagated to DropBox in one go.
    Zero implies all events possible. The default is zero.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.blockSize"  value="0"/>

-   ignoreSysFiles

    If this is True events concerning system files, such as filenames
    beginning with a dot or default new folder names, are ignored. The exact
    events ignored will be OS-dependent. The default is True.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.ignoreSysFiles"  value="True"/>

-   ignoreDirEvents

    If this is True then the creation and modification of subdirectories is
    not reported to DropBox. The default is True.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.ignoreDirEvents"  value="True"/>

-   dirImportWait

    The time in seconds that DropBox should wait after being notified of a
    file before starting an import on that file. This allows for companion
    files or filesets to be copied. If a new file is added to a fileset
    during this wait period DropBox begins waiting again. The default is 60
    seconds.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.dirImportWait"  value="60"/>

-   fileBatch

    The number of files that can be copied in before processing the batch.
    In cases where there are large numbers of files in a typical file set it
    may be more efficient to set this value higher. The default is 10.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.fileBatch"  value="10"/>

-   throttleImport

    The time in seconds that DropBox should wait after initiating an import
    before initiating a second import. If imports are started too close
    together connection issues can arise. The default is 10 seconds.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.throttleImport"  value="10"/>

-   readers

    A file of readers. If this is a valid file then it is used to filter
    those events that are of interest. Only files corresponding to a reader
    in the file will be imported. The default is empty.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.readers"  value=""/>

-   importArgs

    A string of extra arguments supplied to the importer. This could
    include, for example, an email address to report failed imports to:
    ``--report --send -email=test@example.com`` The default is empty.

    ::

        <property name="omero.fs.importArgs"  value=""/>

Example

    <property name="omero.fs.eventTypes"      value="Creation,Modification;Creation,Modification"/>
    <property name="omero.fs.pathMode"        value="Follow;Follow"/>
    <property name="omero.fs.whitelist"       value=";"/>
