Public data in the repository
=============================

The OMERO.web framework allows raw data to be published using built-in tools
or supplied through webservices to the external web resources. This feature is
available only after granting access to the selected datasets and making them
visible to the 'public user', ensuring you always have control over access to
your data.

There are three ways of publishing data using OMERO.web:

- using a URL to launch the web-based Image viewer, as described in
  :ref:`launching_web_viewer`, which can be accompanied by a thumbnail. For
  more details of how to load the thumbnail see
  :ref:`urls_from_within_OMERO_web`

- embedding the image viewport directly into other web resources, for more
  details see :ref:`embedding_web_viewport`

- allowing public access to the OMERO.web data manager

The sections below describe how to set up these features.

Public user
-----------

The OMERO.web framework supports auto-login for a single username / password.
This means that any public visitors to certain OMERO.web pages will be
automatically logged in and will be able to access the data available to the
defined 'public user'.

To set this up on your OMERO.web installation:

- Create a group with read-only permissions (the name can be anything e.g.
  "public-data"). We recommend read-only permissions so that the public user
  will not be able to modify, delete or annotate data belonging to other
  members.

- Create a member of this group, noting the username and password (you will
  enter these below). Again, the First Name, Last Name, username and
  password can be anything you like.

  .. note:: If you add this member to other groups, all data in these groups
      will also become publicly accessible for as long as this user remains
      in the group.

- Enable the :property:`omero.web.public.enabled` property and set
  :property:`omero.web.public.user` and
  :property:`omero.web.public.password`:

  ::

     $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.enabled True

     $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.user '<username>'

     $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.password '<password>'

- Set the :property:`omero.web.public.url_filter`. This filter is a
  regular expression that will allow only matching URLs to be accessed
  by the public user.

  There are three common use cases for the URL filter:

  - Enable 'webgateway' URLs which includes everything needed for the
    full image viewer:

    ::

       $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.url_filter '^/webgateway'


    without the ability to download data:

    ::

       $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.url_filter '^/webgateway/(?!archived_files|download_as)'


    Then you can access public images via the following link
    `\http://your_host/webgateway/img_detail/IMAGE_ID/`.

  - Create your own public pages in a separate app
    (see :doc:`create app </developers/Web/CreateApp>`) and allow
    public access to that app. For example, to allow only
    URLs that start with '/my_web_public' you would use:

    ::

       $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.url_filter '/my_web_public'


  - You can use the full webclient UI for public browsing of images.
    However, the webclient UI was not designed for public use and allows
    various actions that create data or are resource intensive.
    These can be selectively disabled using the following command:

    ::

       $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.url_filter '^/(?!webadmin|webclient/(action|logout|annotate_(file|tags|comment|rating|map)|script_ui|ome_tiff|figure_script)|webgateway/(archived_files|download_as))'

- Set the :property:`omero.web.public.server_id` which the public user will be
  automatically connected to. Default: 1 (the first server in the
  :property:`omero.web.server_list`)

  ::

     $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.server_id 1

If you wish to mix public and restricted access to the system, a registered
user can always access the login page using the following link
`\https://your_host/webclient/login/`.


Reusing OMERO session
---------------------

As an alternative to granting permanent public access to the data, the
OMERO.web framework supports password-less, OMERO session key-based
authentication. For example a direct link to image will look as follows:

::

    https://your_host/webgateway/img_detail/IMAGE_ID/?server=SERVER_ID&bsession=OMERO_SESSION_KEY

.. note::

    The `SERVER_ID` should match the index from the list set using
    :property:`omero.web.server_list` from the server session
    you created. If your list contains only one server, the index will be 1.

For more details about how to create an OMERO session see
:doc:`server-side session </developers/Server/Sessions>` or
use the :doc:`command line interface </users/cli/sessions>` to create one.
