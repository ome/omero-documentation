What's new for OMERO 5.3 for sysadmins
======================================

- Ice 3.6 is now the default supported version. With Ice 3.6, the Python
  bindings are provided separately, allowing you to install the RPM
  packages provided by ZeroC. Then run ``pip install zeroc-ice`` to install
  the Ice Python bindings if your package manager does not provide the Ice
  Python packages.

- All OMERO web apps can now be installed using ``pip install``.

- Windows support discontinued, see :doc:`/sysadmins/windows-migration`.

- OMERO.web has been decoupled from the server and can now be deployed
  separately. Support for deployment using Apache has been dropped.
