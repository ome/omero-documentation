What's new for OMERO 5.3 for sysadmins
======================================

- Ice 3.6 is now the default supported version. With Ice 3.6, the Python
  bindings are provided separately, allowing you to install the RPM
  packages provided by ZeroC. Then run ``pip install zeroc-ice`` to install
  the Ice Python bindings if your package manager does not provide the Ice
  Python packages.

- :doc:`version-requirements` has been updated to reflect other changes in
  version support for 5.3.0 and tentative plans for 5.4.0.
  
- All official OMERO.web apps can now be installed from PyPI. You should
  reinstall your plugins when you upgrade.

- Windows support discontinued, see :doc:`/sysadmins/windows-migration`.

- OMERO.web has been decoupled from the server and can now be deployed
  separately. Support for deployment using Apache has been dropped; if your
  organization’s policies only allow Apache to be used as the external-facing
  web-server you should configure Apache to proxy connections to an Nginx
  instance running on your OMERO server i.e. use Apache as a reverse proxy.

- jquery cache is now disabled by default.
