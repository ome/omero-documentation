Permissions
===========

In the 4.4 release of OMERO, the groups and permissions system has been
revamped to allow users to share data with more control. **Users can now
copy data between groups that they are a member of**.

Overview
--------

A user may belong to one or more groups, and the data in a group may
now **at most** be shared with users in the same group on the same
OMERO server. The degree to which their data is available to other
members of the group depends on the permissions settings for that
group. Whenever a user logs on to an OMERO server, they are connected
under one of their groups. All data they import and any work that is
done is assigned to the current group, however now in 4.4 the user can
easily copy their data into another group.

Users
-----

.. glossary::


	**Administrator**
		Your OMERO server will have one or more
		administrators. Each group can be administrated by any of your server
		administrators. The administrators control all settings for groups.

	**Group owner**
		Your group may have one or more owners. The group
		owner has some additional rights within each group than a standard
		group member, including the ability to add other members to the
		group.
	
	**Group member**
		This is the standard user.


Groups and users must be created by the server administrator. Users can
then be added by the administrator or by one of the group owners
assigned by the administrator. This would typically be the PI of the
lab. The group's owners or server administrator can also choose the
permission level for that group. See the OMERO.insight and OMERO.web admin 
movies below for more information about groups and how to administrate them in
OMERO.

Group permission levels
-----------------------

The various permission levels are:

.. glossary::


	**Private**


		This group is the most restrictive:

		-  A private :term:`Group owner` can see and control who the group members are and can view their data.
		-  As a :term:`Group member`, you will only ever be able to see your own data.
		-  This can be used for general data storage, access and analysis, but has very limited collaboration potential other than for the :term:`Group owner` to see other group members data.

		**Potential Use-Cases of Private group:**

		-  This group would be designed so that a PI as :term:`Group owner` and their student, as a :term:`Group member`, can access the student's data. A student might use this as somewhere to store all of their data and from here, the PI and/or student might decide which data could/should be copied into a more collaborative group where additional members would also be able to view the data.
		-  For an institutional repository type structure where data are being archived, but not necessarily open for general viewing.

	**Read-only**


		This group is the intermediate option that allows visibility of other users and their data, but minimal ability to annotate their data:

		-  The :term:`Group owner` can control group members as above and can perform some annotations on the other group members data.
		-  :term:`Group member` can see who other members are and view their data, but he cannot annotate another members' data at all.

		**Potential Use-Cases of Read-only group:**

		-  A scientist might move data into a read-only group when they want other group members to access and view their data. Other members can view, while the group owners can annotate and/or add Regions of Interest (ROIs) to the other member's images.
		-  For an institutional repository where data are being archived and then available for other users in the institute to view; this could be standard storage of all original data, or for data that is included in publications.

	**Read-annotate**


		This is the most collaborative group:

		-  :term:`Group member` can view other members, their data and can make annotations on those other members' data.

		**Potential Use-Cases:**

		-  This could be used by a group of scientists working together with data for a publication.

Changing group permissions
--------------------------

It is possible for the :term:`Group owner` or server :term:`Administrator` to change the
permissions level on a group after it has been created and filled
with data, with the following limitations:

-  It is not possible to 'reduce' permissions to :term:`Private`. Once links
   have been created in the database under :term:`Read-only` or :term:`Read-annotate`
   permissions, these cannot be severed. However, it is possible to
   'promote' a :term:`Private` group to be a :term:`Read-only` or :term:`Read-annotate` group.
-  It is possible to toggle permissions of a group between the two
   collaborative :term:`Read-only` and :term:`Read-annotate` groups.

**Known Issue**

Please be very careful before downgrading a group's permission level. If
a user has annotated other users' data and the group is downgraded,
any links to annotations that are not permitted with the new permissions
setting will be lost.

Permissions on your and other users' data
-----------------------------------------

**What can you do with your data?**

All OMERO users in all groups can perform all actions to their own data.

The main actions available include, but are not limited to:

-  Create projects and/or datasets.
-  Import data.
-  Delete data.
-  Edit names and descriptions of images.
-  Change rendering settings on images.
-  Annotate images (rate, tag, add attachments and comment).
-  De-annotate (remove annotations that you have added).
-  Use Regions of Interest (ROIs) (add, import, edit, delete, save and analyze with them).
-  Run scripts.
-  Move data between groups, if you belong to more than one group.

**What can you do with someone else's data in your group?**

Actions available for you on someone else in your group's data will
depend both on the permissions of the group you are working in, and what
sort of user you are. See the table below for a quick reference
guide to permissions available on other people's data.

Some of these policies may evolve as the permissions functionality
matures in response to user feedback. Please let us know any comments or
suggestions you have via our :community_plone:`mailing lists <mailing-lists>`
or through the :forum:`forums <>`.

Permissions tables
------------------

The following are the permissions valid for users working on data belonging to other
group members. These permissions depend on the group permissions and on the type
of the user performing the action.

.. glossary:: :sorted:



	Action
		Action on other users' data

	View
		View other users' data such as images. View ROIs added by others.  Draw ROIs on other
		users' data, but they cannot be saved.

	Annotate
		Add annotations (rating, tag, attachment, comment ROI)
		to another users' data.  Also create & save ROIs (save
		ROIs that you draw on another users' data).

	Render
		Create your own rendering settings (this will not
		modify the settings of the owner).

	Delete

		Delete data such as images or ROIs.  ROIs may have been
		added by others or yourself.
		

	Edit
		Modify the name or description of other users'
		objects such as images.

	Move between groups
		Only the admin has the right to move other users’
		data between groups.

		.. note::
			The admin does not have to be member of the
			destination group.

	Remove annotations
		Remove annotations made by others on your data.

	Link
		Copy, Move or Remove other users' data to or from your Projects, Datasets or Screens.
		Copy, Move or Remove your or others' data to or from others' Projects, Datasets or Screens.

		.. note::
			You should always be able to remove
			annotations (such as tags) that you linked to
			other users' data (you own the link).  The
			link can be deleted, but the tag itself will
			not be deleted.


Issues to be aware of
---------------------

ROIs
~~~~

-  You can never edit (change text or move) other users' ROI.
-  Any ROIs added to other users' data will not affect ROIs added by
   the owner.

Tags and attachments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A tag or attachment is 'owned' by the person who creates it or
   uploads it to the server.
-  The link between a tag or an attachment is 'owned' by the person who
   annotates an image with that tag or attachment i.e. makes a link
   between the tag/attachment and the image.
-  De-annotation deletes the link between the tag/attachment and image
   but does not remove/delete the tag or attachment from the system.

Scripts
~~~~~~~

-  Although all users can run scripts on other users' data, the actions
   within those scripts will be subject to the restrictions of the
   permissions detailed in the tables above.
