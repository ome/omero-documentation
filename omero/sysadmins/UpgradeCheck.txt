OMERO upgrade checks
====================

On each startup the OMERO server checks for available upgrades via the
:source:`UpgradeCheck class <components/common/src/ome/system/UpgradeCheck.java>`.
An HTTP GET call is made to the URL configured in
``etc/omero.properties`` as ``omero.upgrades.url``, currently
`Â http://upgrade.openmicroscopy.org.uk <http://upgrade.openmicroscopy.org.uk>`_
by default. (Viewing this page in your browser will redirect you to this

Actions
-------

Currently the only action taken when an upgrade is necessary is a log
statement at WARN level.

::

    2011-09-01 12:21:32,070 WARN  [                 ome.system.UpgradeCheck] (      main) UPGRADE AVAILABLE:Please upgrade to Beta-4.3.3 See http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero for the latest version

Future versions may also send emails and/or IMs to administrators. In
the case of critical upgrades, the server may refuse to start.

Privacy
-------

Currently, the only information which is being transmitted to the server
is:

-  Java virtual machine version
-  operating system details (architecture, version and name)
-  current server version
-  poll frequency (for determining statistics)
-  your IP address (standard HTTP header information)

.. note:: Currently the "poll" property is unused.

If this is a problem for your site, please see *Disabling* below.

Disabling
---------

If you would prefer to have no checks made, the check can be disabled by
setting the omero.upgrades.url property to an empty string:

::

    omero.upgrades.url=

Developers
----------

To use the UpgradeCheck class from your own
code, it is necessary to have ``common.jar`` on your classpath. Then,

::

        ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("omero")
        String version = bundle.getString("omero.version");
        String url = bundle.getString("omero.upgrades.url");
        ome.system.UpgradeCheck check = new UpgradeCheck(
          url, version, "insight"); // Or "importer", etc.
        check.run();
        check.isUpgradeNeeded();
        // optionally
        check.isExceptionThrown();

will connect to the server and check your current version against the
latest release.

Updating the registry version after a release
---------------------------------------------

::

    $ psql -h localhost -U postgres feedback

    feedback=# select * from registry_version;
     id |  version   
    ----+------------
      1 | Beta-4.2.2
    (1 row)

    feedback=# select now();
                  now              
    -------------------------------
     2011-06-27 16:01:30.749654+01
    (1 row)

    feedback=# update registry_version set version = 'Beta-4.3.0' where id = 1;
    UPDATE 1
