Performance and Monitoring
==========================

Once you have your OMERO server running and secured, a second
critical step will be tuning various configuration parameters
in order to get optimal performance.

.. _jvm_memory_settings:

Memory configuration
--------------------

OMERO should automatically configure itself to take advantage of the physical
memory installed on a system whilst leaving room for other services. You may
wish to override the defaults on a production server, for instance if your
machine is solely dedicated to running OMERO you can increase the amount of
memory that OMERO will use. You may also need to modify your settings if you
are seeing out-of-memory errors when dealing with certain types of images.

A number of configuration properties starting with
:ref:`omero.jvmcfg <jvm_configuration>` control the calculation of how
much memory to allocate to various OMERO services on startup, most
importantly:

* blitz
* indexer
* pixeldata

Configuration properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuration properties can either be applied to all three service
types at the same time by omitting the service type (e.g.
:term:`omero.jvmcfg.strategy`) or to each individually by including it
(e.g. `omero.jvmcfg.strategy.blitz`).


For example, the default, PercentStrategy, is equivalent to making the call:

::

	$ bin/omero config set omero.jvmcfg.strategy percent

This could be changed to use the ManualStrategy for all servers:

::

	$ bin/omero config set omero.jvmcfg.strategy manual

Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^

A couple of strategies are available for calculating the effective
JVM settings from the provided configuration properties.

.. glossary::

    PercentStrategy
        Default. Reads the `percent` configuration property which can also be
        set globally or on a service-type basis. This percentage (0-100)
        of the system memory is used for the process, subject to minimum
        and maximum limits which can be changed.
        :term:`omero.jvmcfg.system_memory`,
        :term:`omero.jvmcfg.min_system_memory`, and
        :term:`omero.jvmcfg.max_system_memory` are all used for defining the
        system memory seen. The default percentages are: blitz and
        pixeldata 15%, indexer 10%. If :term:`omero.jvmcfg.perm_gen` or
        :term:`omero.jvmcfg.heap_size` are explicitly set, they will
        be used directly as with the :term:`ManualStrategy`.

    ManualStrategy
        Simply provides the values given as the JVM settings. If no
        value is set for a particular configuration property, then
        the default is used: `heap_size=512m` and `perm_gen=128m`
        These values are equivalent to the defaults in OMERO 5.0.2
        and earlier.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

::

	$ bin/omero config set omero.jvmcfg.percent.blitz 50

would raise the blitz heap size to 50% of the system memory seen.

::

	$ bin/omero config set omero.jvmcfg.system_memory 24000

would set the system memory seen to 24GB regardless of the actual amount of
memory present in the system. The PercentageStrategy would use this as the
basis for setting the Java heap sizes for all services.

::

	$ bin/omero config set omero.jvmcfg.max_system_memory 64000

would raise the maximum system memory seen by an OMERO installation to 64000MB
of system memory. Assuming there was at least 64000MB of memory installed
blitz would default to using 9600MB.

::

	$ bin/omero config set omero.jvmcfg.strategy.indexer manual
	$ bin/omero config set omero.jvmcfg.heap_size.indexer 2000

would set the indexer heap size to 2000MB without modifying the settings for
the other services.


Tips
^^^^

After modifying any memory settings, be sure to restart your server.

::

	$ bin/omero admin restart

.. _jvm_monitoring:

Monitoring
----------

In addition to watching the OMERO log files, the |JVM| itself provides a number
of tools that you can use to determine the health of your server. `JVisualVM`_,
for example, can be used to visualize the memory use of each |JVM|:

.. figure:: /images/JVisualVM.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Screenshot of JVisualVM

You will need to have the |PID| for the service you want to monitor, which
will usually be the main Blitz process. You can find the |PID| either via
:omerocmd:`admin diagnostics` or alternatively via the `jps` command found
in the JDK.

Another tool, `JConsole`_, also provides access to the memory statistics
for your |JVM|, but also lists the |JMX| management beans which provide
extensive information about the running process. Information includes the
number of queries that have been run, the number of open file handles,
the system properties that were set on startup, and much more. Further,
the :ref:`ome.system.metrics <jvm_metrics>` package makes use of JMX
to expose further properties.

.. figure:: /images/JConsole.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Screenshot of JConsole

With :ref:`further configuration <jmx_configuration>`, |JMX| properties
can also be accessed remotely which can be very useful for monitoring
your server with `Check_MK`_, `Nagios`_, `Zenoss`_, or similar. However,
care must be taken to protect the exposed ports.

.. note::

    The commands above require the Java |JDK| as opposed to the |JRE|.

.. _jvm_metrics:

Metrics
-------

Building on top of the `Codahale`_ "Metrics" library, OMERO provides
the ome.system.metrics package which measures a number of internal
events and makes them available both via |JMX| as described under
:ref:`jvm_monitoring` but also prints them to the log files.

By default, these values are printed to each of the |JVM|-based log
files (e.g. :file:`var/log/Blitz-0.log`, :file:`var/log/Indexer-0.log`,
etc) once per hour. This value can be configured via
:term:`omero.metrics.slf4j_minutes`. A typical value might look like:

.. parsed-literal::

    11:28:18,923 INFO  [                      ome.system.metrics] (r-thread-1) type=TIMER, name=ome.services.fulltext.FullTextIndexer.batch ...

Values include basic statistics (`count`, `min`, `max`, `mean`, etc.) as well
as 75th, 90th, 95th, etc percentiles.
Further, the rate over the last minute, the last 5 minutes, and the last 15
minutes is provided  (`m1`, `m5`, `m15`).
For example:

* `count=3601`
* `min=0.41...`
* `max=7.85...`
* `mean=0.94...`
* `stddev=0.31...`
* `median=0.96...`
* `p75=1.08...`
* `p95=1.25...`
* `p98=1.35...`
* `p99=1.43...`
* `p999=7.69...`
* `mean_rate=0.50...`
* `m1=0.49...`
* `m5=0.499...`
* `m15=0.49...`
* `rate_unit=events/second`
* `duration_unit=milliseconds`

Useful metrics include:

.. glossary::

    ch.qos.logback.core.Appender.error
      The number and rate of errors that have been logged. (All services)

    jvm.fileDescriptorCountRatio
      The ratio of used to available file descriptors. (All services)

    ome.services.eventlogs.EventLogQueue.priorityCount
      The number of items in the queue. (Indexer-only)

    ome.io.nio.PixelsService.minmaxTimes
      Time taken to generate min/max values per plane. (PixelData-only)

    ome.io.nio.PixelsService.tileTimes`
      Time taken to generate tiled-pyramids for a big image. (PixelData-only)
