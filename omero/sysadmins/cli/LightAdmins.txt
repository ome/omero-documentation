Adjusting administrator restrictions
====================================

OMERO 5.4 introduced the concept of a restricted administrator. These
and each of the specific permissions restrictions are described in
:doc:`/developers/Server/LightAdmins`. OMERO.web offers easy management
of restrictions and is recommended for setting up restricted
administrators via its :help:`Admin tab <facility-manager#lightadmin>`.

OMERO.cli does not offer easy management of restrictions because support
is yet to be added. In the meantime it can already manipulate
administrator restrictions in the awkward manner described hereunder.

.. warning::

  OMERO.web provides a simplified view of the available restrictions:
  *one* checkbox offered in the web interface may represent *multiple*
  underlying restrictions. The recommended OMERO.web management
  interface may thus prove confusing if OMERO.cli has been used to set a
  combination of restrictions that does not correspond to those bundles
  of related restrictions available in OMERO.web.


View an administrator's restrictions
------------------------------------

For an administrator with user ID 123, :omerocmd:`hql "SELECT ap.name
FROM Experimenter user JOIN user.config AS ap WHERE user.id = 123 AND
ap.name LIKE 'AdminPrivilege:%' AND LOWER(ap.value) <> 'true' ORDER BY
ap.name"` lists their applicable restrictions such that the
administrator may *not* exercise privileges for that operation.


Set a restriction on an administrator
-------------------------------------

For an administrator with user ID 123, :omerocmd:`obj map-set
Experimenter:123 config AdminPrivilege:SomePrivilege false` restricts
them so that they may no longer exercise `SomePrivilege`.


Clear a restriction from an administrator
-----------------------------------------

For an administrator with user ID 123, :omerocmd:`obj map-set
Experimenter:123 config AdminPrivilege:SomePrivilege true` removes a
restriction so that they may exercise `SomePrivilege`.

.. note::

  You may not clear a restriction from an administrator if you have that
  same restriction applying to yourself.

.. warning::

  Never clear `AdminPrivilege:ReadSession` from a restricted
  administrator unless clearing *all* their restrictions to make them
  into a full administrator. No restricted administrator should be able
  to read all OMERO sessions.
