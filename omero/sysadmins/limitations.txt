Known Limitations
=================

Windows OS issues
-----------------

OMERO.web 'development server' does not work under Windows XP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The development server included with OMERO.web does not work under
Windows XP. This server is included to allow you to easily evaluate
and develop the OMERO.web component. As it should not be used in a
production environment, while an inconvenience, this should not stop
the deployment of a production version of OMERO.web. See :forum:`OME forum
topic <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=640>`.

Binary delete
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Windows servers not all binary files corresponding to a delete may
be removed from the binary repository. See 
:ref:`DeleteBinaryData` for more details.

Mac OS X issues
---------------

C++ compilation problems on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under certain circumstances building OmeroCpp on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow
Leopard) can fail with "ld: symbol(s) not found". You can find further
details, a potential solution and make any comments on your experience
with the problem on :ticket:`3210`.

Web Start problems on Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new security features in Mac OS X 10.8 prevent users from launching
OMERO.insight via Java Web Start using the standard system security
settings. The system wide setting needs to be changed in preferences,
and this would have security implications. We are looking into code 
signing to resolve this issue.

Ubuntu issues
-------------

Importing using desktop clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under older Ubuntu installations, the 'import folder' option in the desktop 
clients currently does not work.

Searching
---------

Not finding certain pieces of data in wildcard searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes data is missed when certain types of wildcard searches are
performed. You can find further details on :ticket:`3164`.

File format support
-------------------

DeltaVision OMX files (.hdr) files not viewable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some files generated by an OMX system have a pixel type of float and a
large dynamic range. While the files import into OMERO they are
currently not viewable. This fix would require deep changes to several
parts of the code and we have chosen not to make the changes yet. See
:ticket:`3256`.

LDAP
----

Enabling synchronisation of LDAP on user login will result in LDAP
being treated as the authority on both group membership and also the
available groups. Any groups defined in OMERO and not in LDAP will
result in users being removed from these groups. The groups will still
exist in OMERO but user membership will be treated as being defined by
LDAP alone.
