Known Limitations
=================

Windows OS issues
-----------------

OMERO.web 'development server' does not work under Windows XP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The development server included with OMERO.web does not work under
Windows XP. This server is included to allow you to easily evaluate
and develop the OMERO.web component. As it should not be used in a
production environment, while an inconvenience, this should not stop
the deployment of a production version of OMERO.web. See :forum:`OME forum
topic <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=640>`.

Binary delete
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Windows servers not all binary files corresponding to a delete may
be removed from the binary repository. See :ref:`DeleteBinaryData` for more
details.

Ice 3.5
^^^^^^^

The Ice 3.5 OMERO.server is not supported on Windows out of the box because
the Ice 3.5 binaries from ZeroC_ require Python 3, which OMERO does not
support (see :forum:`OME forum topic <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=7352>`). This
limitation does not affect Windows Ice 3.5 clients which can connect to an Ice
3.4 server.

Mac OS X issues
---------------

C++ compilation problems on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under certain circumstances building OmeroCpp can fail with "ld: symbol(s) not
found". You can find further details, a potential solution and make any
comments on your experience with the problem on :ticket:`3210`.

Ubuntu issues
-------------

Importing using desktop clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under older Ubuntu installations, the 'import folder' option in the desktop
clients currently does not work.

Searching
---------

Not finding certain pieces of data in wildcard searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes data is missed when certain types of wildcard searches are
performed. You can find further details on :ticket:`3164`.

Importing
---------

.. _limitations-logback:

Import failures when importing many filesets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with OMERO 5, the importer creates an import log for each
fileset stored by OMERO.fs.  These files are kept open for 30 minutes
by `logback <http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-244>`_.  If many
filesets are imported sequentially, this 30 minute timeout can lead to
the server running out of file handles due to the amount of open log
files, which are closed at a slower rate than new logs are opened.
This problem is most likely to manifest when hundreds of very fast
imports occur within a short period of time. This will be addressed in
a future release.  In the interim, one workaround is to increase the
maximum number of open files per process.  On Linux, this may be done
by setting the `nofile` limit in :file:`/etc/security/limits.conf`,
for example::

  omero  soft  nofile  10000
  omero  hard  nofile  12000

This permits the `omero` user to have 10000 open files per process,
which may be increased up to a maximum of 12000 by the user.  The
username and limits will need adjusting for the specifics of your
installation and usage requirements.  Note that these settings take
effect only for new logins, so the server and the shell or environment
the server is started from will require restarting.  Run ``ulimit -a``
as the user running OMERO to verify that the changes have taken
effect.

File format support
-------------------

DeltaVision OMX files (.hdr) files not viewable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some files generated by an OMX system have a pixel type of float and a
large dynamic range. While the files import into OMERO they are
currently not viewable. This fix would require deep changes to several
parts of the code and we have chosen not to make the changes yet. See
:ticket:`3256`.

LDAP
----

Enabling synchronization of LDAP on user login will result in LDAP
being treated as the authority on both group membership and also the
available groups. Any groups defined in OMERO and not in LDAP will
result in users being removed from these groups. The groups will still
exist in OMERO but user membership will be treated as being defined by
LDAP alone.
