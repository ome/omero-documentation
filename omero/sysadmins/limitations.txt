Known Limitations
=================

Data management issues
----------------------

Moving data between groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When moving images into a different group from the one they were uploaded 
into, important attached metadata, such as file annotations and rendering 
settings, may be lost. This may especially affect moving data into a group 
with more restrictive permissions. See :ticket:`10419` and :ticket:`9610` for 
further details and to leave comments on your experience with this problem.

Moving projected images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moving a dataset containing projected images into a different group may result 
in an error when trying to view the projected images, and the original image 
the projection was created from may be lost. See :ticket:`10262` for further 
details and to leave comments on your experience with this problem.

Deleting projected images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It may not to possible to delete an image you own in a collaborative group if 
a projected image has been created from it, due to shared metadata. See 
:ticket:`11529` for further details or to comment on your experience with this 
issue.

Deleting SVS images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deleting an image which shares an original SVS file with another image is 
currently resulting in the archived original SVS file also being deleted and 
no longer accessible from the other image. See :ticket:`11348` for further 
details or to comment on your experience with this problem.

Windows OS issues
-----------------

OMERO.web 'development server' does not work under Windows XP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The development server included with OMERO.web does not work under
Windows XP. This server is included to allow you to easily evaluate
and develop the OMERO.web component. As it should not be used in a
production environment, while an inconvenience, this should not stop
the deployment of a production version of OMERO.web. See :forum:`OME forum
topic <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=640>`.

Binary delete
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Windows servers not all binary files corresponding to a delete may
be removed from the binary repository. See 
:ref:`DeleteBinaryData` for more details.

Mac OS X issues
---------------

C++ compilation problems on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under certain circumstances building OmeroCpp can fail with "ld: symbol(s) not 
found". You can find further details, a potential solution and make any 
comments on your experience with the problem on :ticket:`3210`.

Web Start problems on Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new security features prevent users from launching
OMERO.insight via Java Web Start using the standard system security
settings. The system wide setting needs to be changed in preferences,
and this would have security implications. We are looking into code 
signing to resolve this issue.

Ubuntu issues
-------------

Importing using desktop clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under older Ubuntu installations, the 'import folder' option in the desktop 
clients currently does not work.

Searching
---------

Not finding certain pieces of data in wildcard searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes data is missed when certain types of wildcard searches are
performed. You can find further details on :ticket:`3164`.

File format support
-------------------

DeltaVision OMX files (.hdr) files not viewable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some files generated by an OMX system have a pixel type of float and a
large dynamic range. While the files import into OMERO they are
currently not viewable. This fix would require deep changes to several
parts of the code and we have chosen not to make the changes yet. See
:ticket:`3256`.

LDAP
----

Enabling synchronization of LDAP on user login will result in LDAP
being treated as the authority on both group membership and also the
available groups. Any groups defined in OMERO and not in LDAP will
result in users being removed from these groups. The groups will still
exist in OMERO but user membership will be treated as being defined by
LDAP alone.
