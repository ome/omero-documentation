What's new for OMERO 5.4 for sysadmins
======================================

- :doc:`version-requirements` has been updated to reflect other changes in
  version support for 5.4.0 and tentative plans for 5.5.0.

- Walkthroughs have been added for :doc:`installing OMERO.web <unix/install-web/web-deployment>` either separately from
  or with OMERO.server on a variety of platforms.

- A walkthrough has been added for :doc:`unix/server-debian9-ice36`.

- :doc:`admins-with-restricted-privileges` can now be created to allow
  facility managers, image analysts etc. to organize users and data in OMERO
  without having to be granted full administrator privileges.

- The Public user is restricted to GET requests by default. This can be
  changed by setting the new configuration property
  :property:`omero.web.public.get_only`.

For a full list of bug fixes and other improvements, see the
:doc:`/users/history`.
