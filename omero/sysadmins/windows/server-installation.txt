OMERO.server installation
=========================

.. seealso::

    :doc:`/sysadmins/server-upgrade`
         Instructions for **upgrading** your OMERO.server installation.

Limitations
-----------

Installation **will require an "Administrator" level account** for which you
know the password. If you are unsure of what it means to have an "Administrator"
level account, or if you are generally having issues with the various
users/passwords described in this install guide, please see
:ref:`troubleshooting-password`.

-  Unless you are clear on the differences, **you should also open all 
   consoles as an administrator to prevent file permission issues.**

       :alt:

-  Installation on Windows XP is not explicitly supported, especially
   for OMERO.web. Significant testing has taken place on Windows Server
   2008 and we recommend this version.
-  :doc:`/sysadmins/omeromovie` is not supported on Windows at present.
-  Spaces in installation path names are not currently supported.

   .. note::

      The default user paths on Windows usually contain spaces so you
      will need to ensure the path has no spaces, :file:`C:\\OMERO.server`
      for example.
-  A reboot is required after installing the prerequisites.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. note::

    The installation of these prerequisite applications is outside the scope
    of this document.

The following are necessary:

Java SE Development Kit (JDK) (1.5 or higher) 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Java SE Downloads are available from `<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_

Ice (3.3.x or 3.4.x)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    All versions of OMERO including and before 4.3 support only Ice 3.3. You
    will need to download these from
    :zeroc:`ZeroC's previous versions section <previous.html>`. OMERO 4.4 adds
    support for Ice 3.4 while keeping support for Ice 3.3. For OMERO.server
    you will need to pick the appropriate downloads for the version of Ice
    you have installed locally. The downloads for Ice 3.4 have "ice34" in the
    zip name.

    The downloads for the OMERO.clients (written in Java) are all ice33
    builds. We provide the :file:`ice.jar` bundled with the clients,
    so you do not need to worry about which one you download. If you have
    further questions, consult the :forum:`Forums <>`.


Windows installers of Ice can be found on the :zeroc:`ZeroC download
page <download.html>` and will be called something like :file:`Ice-3.4.2.msi`
(for Ice 3.4.2). If you plan to develop for C++, be sure to read the
instructions on the |OmeroCpp| page.

Users have reported that under certain conditions installing Ice in the
default location (:file:`C:\\Program Files`) might break the Windows
:envvar:`PATH` (due to special characters present in the file name). In cases
where :omerocmd:`admin diagnostics` throws any errors related to unexpected
paths with Ice, please consider installing Ice in the root of the partition
(e.g. :file:`C:\\Ice`).

Python 2 (2.4 or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ice 3.4.x requires Python 2.6.x. You must download the 32-bit version
from `python.org <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/>`_.
As this is the "vanilla" python distribution (no extra libraries),
you will need to install further dependencies, making sure to
download the correct version (release number, 32/64-bit) for your Python
distribution.

OMERO does not currently support Python 3.

PyWin32
"""""""

It is recommended to use **Python for Windows extensions**. The installer is
available from the `PyWin download page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/>`_.

Additional libraries
""""""""""""""""""""

PostgreSQL (8.4 or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PostgreSQL has to be installed and configured with PL/pgSQL and to accept
TCP connections. PostgreSQL 8.3 and earlier are not supported. See
:doc:`/sysadmins/limitations`. See :doc:`server-postgresql` for specifics
about each version.

The *One click installer* can be found on the `PostgreSQL Windows
download page <http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows>`_. You
will need the postgres user's password later in the install.

-  You must install PostgreSQL as a service if you want to follow
   this document; other PostgreSQL installation environments are
   supported but are outside the scope of this document.

OMERO.server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **OMERO.server** zip file is available from the :omero_plone:`OMERO
downloads <downloads>` page.

Environment variables
---------------------

For the prerequisite software to run properly, your PATH and PYTHONPATH
environment variables must be configured. If not correctly configured or if
you installed manually to :file:`C:\\ice` or a similar location, you will
need to set the values yourself.

**Update your Windows environment variables: (REQUIRES RESTART!)**

#. Locate the *System* control panel page on the Start Menu under
   :menuselection:`Settings --> Control Panel`, open it and navigate to the
   :guilabel:`Advanced` tab (on Windows Vista the dialog will be visible
   after clicking the :guilabel:`Change settings` link on the
   :guilabel:`System` control panel page):

   .. figure:: /images/installation-images/system-properties.png
      :align: center
      :width: 35%
      :alt: Advanced System Properties

      Advanced System Properties
#. Open the :guilabel:`Environment Variables` dialog by clicking on the
   :guilabel:`Environment Variables...` button of the above dialog:

   .. figure:: /images/installation-images/environment-variables.png
      :align: center
      :width: 35%
      :alt: Environment Variables

      Environment Variables
#. Edit the existing *System* environment variable :guilabel:`Path` and add a
   new variable pointing to the Ice installation :file:`bin` directory. At
   the front of the :guilabel:`Path` variable also add a new string pointing
   to the Python installation directory (e.g. :file:`C:\\Python26`). Then
   add a brand new *System* environment variable called
   :guilabel:`PYTHONPATH` pointing to the Ice installation :file:`python` location:

   .. |PATH variable| image:: /images/installation-images/path-variable.png
      :width: 33%
      :alt: Path variable

   .. |PATH variable 2| image:: /images/installation-images/path-variable2.png

      :width: 33%
      :alt: PythonPath variable


   |PATH variable| |PATH variable 2| |PYTHONPATH variable|

#. **Restart your computer**. For environment changes to take
   effect in background services, a restart is unfortunately
   necessary. See `<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/821761>`_
   for more information.

Creating a database for OMERO
-----------------------------

Probably the most important step towards having a working server system
is having a properly configured database.

-  Create a non-superuser database user (make sure to note down the name
   and password) using pgAdmin III. You can find pgAdmin III on
   the Start Menu under :menuselection:`Programs --> PostgreSQL 9.1 --> pgAdmin III`:

   #. Double-click on the :guilabel:`PostgreSQL 9.1` database (or right-
      click and choose :guilabel:`Connect`) and provide your *postgres* user
      login password set during the installation, above.

      .. figure:: /images/install-windows-screenshots/pgadmin-02initialview.png

         :align: center
         :alt: Enter password

         Enter password

   #. Right-click on :guilabel:`Login Roles` and select :guilabel:`New Login
      Role...`

      .. figure:: /images/install-windows-screenshots/pgadmin-04newrole-context.png
         :figwidth: 65%
         :width: 60%
         :align: center
         :alt: New login role

         New login role

   #. Create a new role and record the name and password. You will need to 
      configure OMERO to use your username and password by setting the 
      ``omero.db.name`` and ``omero.db.pass`` properties.

      .. warning::
          For illustrative purposes, the default name and password for the 
          role are ``db_user``  and ``db_password`` respectively. However, 
          you should not use these default values for your installation but 
          use your own choice of username and password instead.

   .. figure:: /images/install-windows-screenshots/pgadmin-05newrole-name.png

         :alt: New database name

         New database name

-  Confirm PL/pgSQL language support in your newly created database

   #. First, go to :menuselection:`File --> Options` select the
      :guilabel:`Browser` tab and activate the *Languages* option:

      .. figure:: /images/install-windows-screenshots/pgadmin-09optionsmenu.png

         Enable display of installed languages

   #. Navigate back to your database, expand the database's tree view
      and finally expand the now available :guilabel:`Languages` item:

   #. If the ``plpgsql`` language is missing, right-click on the
      :guilabel:`Extensions` item and select the
      :guilabel:`New extension...` option in the menu. Finally, add the
      ``plpgsql`` extension, accepting all defaults. This will add both the
      extension and the language. In older PostgreSQL versions without
      extensions, right-click on the :guilabel:`Languages` item and select
      the :guilabel:`New language...` option in the menu. Finally, add the
      ``plpgsql`` language, accepting all defaults.

         New language name

Location for your OMERO binary repository
-----------------------------------------

.. seealso::
    :doc:`OMERO.server binary repository <server-binary-repository>`

-  Create a directory for the OMERO binary data repository
   (:file:`C:\\OMERO` is the default location and should be used unless you
   explicitly have a reason not to and know what you are doing).

-  This is *not* where you want the OMERO application to be installed,
   it is a *separate* directory that OMERO.server will use to store
   binary data:

   ::

      C:\mkdir OMERO

-  Change the ownership of the directory. :file:`C:\\OMERO` *must* either
   be owned by the user starting the server or that user *must* have
   permission to write to the directory. Please see :doc:`OMERO.server
   binary repository <server-binary-repository>` for more details.

When performing some operations the clients make use of temporary file
storage and log directories. By default these files are stored below the
user's home directory (on Windows :file:`C:\\Users\\<username>`) in
:file:`omero\\tmp`, :file:`omero\\log` and :file:`omero\\sessions`. 

.. note::

    If your home directory  is stored on a network (NFS mounted or similar),
    then file read and write operations occur over the network. This can
    slow access down. It is strongly discouraged to install OMERO on a
    network mapped drive.

The OMERO.server also access the :file:`omero\\tmp` and
:file:`omero\\log` folders of **the user the server process is running
as**. As the server makes heavier use of these folders than the clients,
if that user's home folder is stored on a network the server can be
slowed down. To get round this for the OMERO.server you can define an
``OMERO_TEMPDIR`` environment variable pointing to a temporary directory
located on the local file system e.g. :file:`C:\\tmp\\`.

Installation
------------

-   Extract the OMERO zip file and note its location. Below it is referred
    to as :file:`C:\\OMERO.server`.

-   Optionally, review :file:`C:\\OMERO.server\\etc\\omero.properties` which
    contains all default settings.

    You will need to open the file with a text editor. Do not edit the file.
    Any configuration settings you would like to change can be changed in
    the next step.

-   Change any settings that are necessary using ``bin\omero config``,
    including the name and/or password for the 'db\_user' database user
    you chose above or the database name if it is not "omero\_database".
    (Quotes are only necessary if the value could be misinterpreted by
    the shell. See :forum:`link <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=360#p922>`).

    ::

        C:\> cd C:\OMERO.server
        C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero config set omero.db.name omero_database
        C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero config set omero.db.user db_user
        C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero config set omero.db.pass db_password

-   If you have chosen a non-standard :doc:`OMERO binary repository <server-binary-repository>` 
    location above, be sure to configure the ``omero.data.dir`` property.
    
    When using ``C:\`` style file paths it is necessary to "escape" the 
    backslashes. For example:

    ::

        C:\> bin\omero config set omero.data.dir C:\\OMERO

-   Create the OMERO database initialization script. You will be asked
    for the version of the script which you would like to generate, where
    both defaults can be accepted. Finally, you will be asked to enter and
    confirm password for your newly created OMERO root user.
    
    .. warning:: 

      For illustrative purposes, the default password for the OMERO rootuser 
      is ``root_password``. However, you should not use this default value 
      for your installation but use your own choice of password instead.

      This should **not** be the same password as your Linux/Mac/Windows 
      root user!

    .. parsed-literal::

        C:\\> cd C:\\OMERO.server

           ...
           ...
           omero=> \\q

-   Before starting the OMERO.server we should run the OMERO diagnostics
    script so that we check that all of our settings are correct, e.g.

    ::

        C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero admin diagnostics

-   You can now start the server using:

    ::

        C:\OMERO.server> bin\omero admin start
        Creating C:\OMERO.server\var\master
        Creating C:\OMERO.server\var\registry
        No descriptor given. Using etc\grid\windefault.xml
        Installing OMERO.master Windows service.
        Successfully installed OMERO.master Windows service.
        Starting OMERO.master Windows service.
        Waiting on startup. Use CTRL-C to exit
        ...

    If you have chosen a non-default install directory (other than
    :file:`C:\\OMERO.server`), the output will look like this:

    ::

        C:\OMERO.server> bin\omero admin start
        Found default value: C:\OMERO.server\var\master
        Attempting to correct...

-  If you would like to move the directory again, see
   ``bin\winconfig.bat --help``, which gets called automatically on an
   initial install.

-  You can now test that you can log-in as "root", either with the
   OMERO.insight client or command-line:

   ::

       C:\OMERO.server> bin\omero login
       Server: [localhost]
       Username: [root]
       Password:         # root_password

OMERO.web and administration
----------------------------

.. note:: In order to deploy OMERO.web in a production environment such as Apache or IIS please follow the instructions under :doc:`install-web`.

Otherwise, the internal Django webserver can be used for evaluation and development. In this case, we need to
turn debugging on, in order that static files can be served by Django:

::

    c:\OMERO.server> bin\omero config set omero.web.application_server development
    c:\OMERO.server> bin\omero config set omero.web.debug True
    c:\OMERO.server> bin\omero config set omero.web.session_engine "django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache"
    c:\OMERO.server> bin\omero config set omero.web.cache_backend "file://C:/windows/temp/"

then start by

::

    c:\OMERO.server> bin\omero web start
    Starting django development webserver... 
    Validating models...
    0 errors found

    Django version 1.1.1, using settings 'omeroweb.settings'
    Development server is running at http://0.0.0.0:4080/
    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

Once you have deployed and started the server you can use your browser
to access the OMERO.web interface:

-  `http://localhost:4080/ <http://localhost:4080/>`_

Post-installation items
-----------------------

Backup
^^^^^^

One of your first steps after putting your OMERO server into production
should be deciding on when and how you are going to :doc:`backup your
database and binary data </sysadmins/server-backup-and-restore>`. Please do not omit this
step.

Security
^^^^^^^^

It is also now recommended that you read the :doc:`/sysadmins/server-security` page
to get a good idea as to what you need to do to get OMERO clients
speaking to your newly installed OMERO.server in accordance with your
institution or company's security policy.

Advanced configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have the base server running, you may want to try enabling some
of the advanced features such as :doc:`/sysadmins/server-fs` or :doc:`/sysadmins/server-ldap`.
If you have ***Flex data***, you may want to watch :snapshot:`the HCS configuration screencast <movies/omero-4-1/mov/FlexPreview4.1-configuration.mov>`.
See the :omero_plone:`Feature list <feature-list>` for more advanced
features you may want to use, and :doc:`/sysadmins/server-advanced-configuration` on how to get the most out of
your server.

Update notification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your OMERO.server installation will check for updates each time it is started from the *Open Microscopy Environment* update server. If you wish to disable this functionality you should do so now as outlined on the :doc:`/sysadmins/UpgradeCheck` page.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My OMERO install doesn't work! What do I do now!?! Examine the :doc:`/sysadmins/troubleshooting` page and if all else fails post a
message to our :mailinglist:`ome-users` mailing list discussed on the :doc:`/users/community-resources` page.

OMERO diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want help with your server installation, please include the output of the diagnostics command:
