OMERO.server installation
=========================

.. seealso::

    :doc:`/sysadmins/server-upgrade`
         Instructions for **upgrading** your OMERO.server installation.

Limitations
-----------

Installation **will require an "Administrator" level account** for which you
know the password. If you are unsure of what it means to have an "Administrator"
level account, or if you are generally having issues with the various
users/passwords described in this install guide, please see
:ref:`troubleshooting-password`.

-  Unless you are clear on the differences, **you should also open all 
   consoles as an administrator to prevent file permission issues.**

       :alt:

-  Significant testing has taken place on Windows Server 2008 and we
   recommend this version.
-  :doc:`/sysadmins/omeromovie` is not supported on Windows at present.
-  A reboot is required after installing the prerequisites.

.. note::

  The default user paths on Windows usually contain spaces so you will need
  to ensure the the server installation path has no spaces,
  :file:`C:\\OMERO.server` for example.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. note::

    The installation of these prerequisite applications is largely outside the 
    scope of this document.

    **Do not mix 32bit (x86) and 64bit (amd64) packages** - install either all 
    32bit or all 64bit. Check your JRE as well.

The following are necessary:

Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Java SE Downloads are available from `<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_.
Java 7 is recommended, Java 6 is supported.

Python 2
^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    OMERO does not currently support Python 3.

**Make sure you install the correct Python 2 version for your Ice version:**

- If you have downloaded Ice 3.5.1 from our downloads page or Ice
  3.6.0 from ZeroC (note that support is currently upcoming, see
  below), you will need to install the `latest Python 2.7 release
  <http://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_.

- If you have installed Ice version 3.4.2 from ZeroC, you need Python
  version 2.6 which you can download from `Python 2.6.6 release
  downloads <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/>`_.

As these are the "vanilla" python distributions (no extra libraries), you will
need to install further dependencies, making sure to download the correct
version (2.6/2.7, 32/64-bit) for your Python distribution.

32/64-bit
"""""""""

OMERO has been extensively tested with both 32-bit and 64-bit Python
on Windows.  You can obtain 64-bit precompiled dependencies from
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs.

Python for Windows extensions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Python for Windows extensions (PyWin32) is required. The installer is
available from the `PyWin download page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/>`_.

The version you need is: 
:file:`pywin32-XXX.win32-pyA.B.exe` (or
:file:`pywin32-XXX.win-amd64-pyA.B.exe` for 64-bit Python) where XXX should be
the latest release number and A and B stand for the Python version, for example
:file:`pywin32-218.win32-py2.6.exe`.

.. _windows_additional_libraries:

Ice
^^^

.. note::

    OMERO |version| supports Ice 3.5 and 3.4; support for 3.6 is
    currently upcoming (experimental and used at your own risk). You
    will need to pick the matching server download for the version of
    Ice you have installed.

    If you are using precompiled packages of Ice and Python
    (recommended) you should use the versions specified below. In
    particular since OMERO does not support Python 3 **it will not
    work with the ZeroC Ice 3.5 package for Windows**. However, Ice
    3.5 will work when built against Python 2.7.  However, the ZeroC
    Ice 3.6 packages do support Python 2.7.

Ice 3.5.1 built against Python 2.7 is available from our `Ice
downloads page <http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/ice/3.5.1/>`_, or
Ice 3.4 installers can be found on the old :zeroc:`ZeroC Ice 3.4.2
download page <download_3_4_2.html>`.  Alternatively, the :zeroc:`Ice
3.6.0 download page <download.html>` provides installers for Windows,
but support for this release is currently upcoming.

If you plan to develop for C++, be sure to read the instructions on the
|OmeroCpp| page.

If you installed Ice 3.6.0, you must then run::

    pip install zeroc-ice

to install the Ice Python bindings.  See `Using the Python
Distribution
<https://doc.zeroc.com/display/Ice36/Using+the+Python+Distribution>`__
for further details.

PostgreSQL (9.2 or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PostgreSQL has to be installed and configured to accept TCP connections.
PostgreSQL 9.1 and earlier are not supported. 9.3 or later is recommended.

The *One click installer* can be found on the `PostgreSQL Windows
download page <http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows>`_.

-  You must install PostgreSQL as a service if you want to follow
   this document.

#. Run the downloaded installer. You may be prompted for permission to
   continue with a "user account control" dialog. Click :guilabel:`yes` to
   continue. The installer will now start.

#. Choose the installation directory. The default is fine.

#. Choose the data directory. The default is fine, but if you want to
   keep the data in a specific location, you may choose an alternative
   location here.

#. Enter a password for the special "postgres" system account. OMERO
   does not use this account, but you will need to record the password
   for creating the database, below.

#. Enter the port number for PostgreSQL to listen on for incoming
   connections. The default, 5432, is fine and should not be changed.

#. Select the locale. The default here is fine.

#. PostgreSQL will now be installed and started.

Environment variables
---------------------

For the prerequisite software to run properly, your PATH and PYTHONPATH
environment variables must be configured. This is particularly important for
Ice, which does not set the required variables by default.

**Update your Windows environment variables: (REQUIRES RESTART!)**

#. Locate the *System* control panel page on the Start Menu under
   :menuselection:`Settings --> Control Panel`, open it and navigate to the
   :guilabel:`Advanced` tab (on Windows Vista the dialog will be visible
   after clicking the :guilabel:`Change settings` link on the
   :guilabel:`System` control panel page):

   .. figure:: /images/installation-images/system-properties.png
      :align: center
      :width: 35%
      :alt: Advanced System Properties

      Advanced System Properties
#. Open the :guilabel:`Environment Variables` dialog by clicking on the
   :guilabel:`Environment Variables...` button of the above dialog:

   .. figure:: /images/installation-images/environment-variables.png
      :align: center
      :width: 35%
      :alt: Environment Variables

      Environment Variables
#. Edit the existing *System* environment variable :guilabel:`Path` and add a
   new variable pointing to the Ice installation :file:`bin` directory. At
   the front of the :guilabel:`Path` variable also add a new string pointing
   to the Python installation directory (e.g. :file:`C:\\Python26`). Then
   add a brand new *System* environment variable called
   :guilabel:`PYTHONPATH` pointing to the Ice installation :file:`python` location:

   .. |PATH variable| image:: /images/installation-images/path-variable.png
      :width: 33%
      :alt: Path variable

   .. |PATH variable 2| image:: /images/installation-images/path-variable2.png
      :width: 33%
      :alt: Path variable

   .. |PYTHONPATH variable| image:: /images/installation-images/pythonpath-variable.png
      :width: 33%
      :alt: PythonPath variable


   |PATH variable| |PATH variable 2| |PYTHONPATH variable|

   **When setting the ENV variables, make sure you write in the correct 
   paths.** 
   You must have entries for:

   - python (the first PATH entry, e.g. "C:\\Python26;%Sys…)

   - ice\bin (the last PATH entry, e.g. "…;C:\\Ice-3.4.2\\bin;")

   - PYTHONPATH pointing to the python folder in the ICE installation (e.g. 
     "C:\\Ice-3.4.2\\python;")

   - For 64-bit you will need to use the 64-bit Ice directories, for example
     "C:\\Ice-3.4.2\\bin\\x64;" and "C:\\Ice-3.4.2\\python\\x64;".

   .. warning:: Remember that the Windows path separator is the semicolon ; 
       and must be appended after every entry.

       Make sure the first inserted ENV PATH entry (the python path) finishes 
       with a semicolon (eg. "C:\\Python26;%SystemRoot%…") otherwise you 
       could corrupt other system applications.


#. **Restart your computer**. For environment changes to take
   effect in background services, a restart is unfortunately
   necessary. See `<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/821761>`_
   for more information.

Creating a database for OMERO
-----------------------------

-  Open pgAdmin III; you can find it on the Start Menu under
   :menuselection:`Programs --> PostgreSQL --> pgAdmin III`.

-  Connect to the database by double-clicking on the :guilabel:`PostgreSQL`
   database (or right-click and choose :guilabel:`Connect`) and providing your
   *postgres* user login password set during the installation, above.

-  Create a new (non-superuser) database user for OMERO:

   #. Right-click on :guilabel:`Login Roles` and select :guilabel:`New Login
      Role...`.

   #. On the :guilabel:`Properties` tab, enter a name for the OMERO database
      user (referenced as ``db_user`` below) as the ``Role name``, for example
      ``omero``. On the :guilabel:`Definition` tab, enter the password for the
      user twice and then press :guilabel:`OK`. Make sure you record this
      username and password for later use; you will need to configure OMERO to
      use your username and password by setting the :property:`omero.db.name`
      and :property:`omero.db.pass` properties.

-  Create a new database for OMERO:

   #. Right-click on :guilabel:`Databases` and select :guilabel:`New Database
      ...`

   #. On the :guilabel:`Properties` tab, enter a name for the OMERO
      database (referenced as ``omero_database`` below) as the ``Name``, for
      example ``omero``, then press :guilabel:`OK`.

Location for your OMERO binary repository
-----------------------------------------

.. seealso::
    :doc:`OMERO.server binary repository <server-binary-repository>`

-  Create a directory for the OMERO binary data repository
   (:file:`C:\\OMERO` is the default location and should be used unless you
   explicitly have a reason not to and know what you are doing).

-  This is *not* where you want the OMERO application to be installed,
   it is a *separate* directory that OMERO.server will use to store
   binary data:

   ::

      C:\mkdir OMERO

-  Change the ownership of the directory. :file:`C:\\OMERO` *must* either
   be owned by the user starting the server or that user *must* have
   permission to write to the directory. Please see :doc:`OMERO.server
   binary repository <server-binary-repository>` for more details.

When performing some operations the clients make use of temporary file
storage and log directories. By default these files are stored below the
user's home directory (on Windows :file:`C:\\Users\\<username>`) in
:file:`omero\\tmp`, :file:`omero\\log` and :file:`omero\\sessions`. 

.. note::

    If your home directory  is stored on a network (NFS mounted or similar),
    then file read and write operations occur over the network. This can
    slow access down. Installing OMERO on a network mapped drive is strongly 
    discouraged.

The OMERO.server also accesses the :file:`omero\\tmp` and
:file:`omero\\log` folders of **the user account running the server 
process**. As the server makes heavier use of these folders than the clients,
if that user's home folder is stored on a network the server can be
slowed down. To get around this for the OMERO.server you can define an
:envvar:`OMERO_TMPDIR` environment variable pointing to a temporary directory
located on the local file system e.g. :file:`C:\\tmp\\`.

Installation
------------

-   Download and extract the OMERO.server zip file, and note its location. 
    Below it is referred to as :file:`C:\\OMERO.server`.

-   Optionally, review :doc:`/sysadmins/config`, which contains all default
    settings. Any configuration settings you would like to change can be
    changed in the next step.

-   Change any settings that are necessary using ``bin\omero config``,
    including the name and/or password for the 'db\_user' database user
    you chose above or the database name if it is not "omero\_database".
    (Quotes are only necessary if the value could be misinterpreted by
    the shell. See :forum:`link <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=360#p922>`).

    ::

        C:\> cd C:\OMERO.server
        C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero config set omero.db.name omero_database
        C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero config set omero.db.user db_user
        C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero config set omero.db.pass db_password

-   If you have chosen a non-standard :doc:`OMERO binary repository <server-binary-repository>` 
    location above, be sure to configure the :property:`omero.data.dir` property.
    
    When using ``C:\`` style file paths it is necessary to "escape" the 
    backslashes. For example:

    ::

        C:\> bin\omero config set omero.data.dir C:\\OMERO

-   Create the OMERO database initialization script. You will be asked
    for the version of the script which you would like to generate, where
    both defaults can be accepted. Finally, you will be asked to enter and
    confirm password for your newly created OMERO root user.
    
    .. warning:: 

      For illustrative purposes, the default password for the OMERO rootuser 
      is ``root_password``. However, you should not use this default value 
      for your installation but use your own choice of password instead.

      This should **not** be the same password as your Linux/Mac/Windows 
      root user!

    .. parsed-literal::

        C:\\> cd C:\\OMERO.server

    The generated SQL file is found in the folder where you called the "omero  
    db script" command. This could cause a permission denied error in the 
    populate db step if the postgres user cannot access that location. Move 
    the file to a different location or use the -f option.

-   Initialize your database with the script.

    #. Launch *SQL Shell (psql)* from the Start Menu under 
       :menuselection:`Programs --> PostgreSQL --> SQL Shell (psql)`

                  \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
                  \q to quit

          Warning: Console code page (437) differs from Windows code page 
                   (1252) 8-bit characters might not work correctly. See psql  
                   reference page "Notes for Windows users" for details.

    #. Execute the following to populate your database (**the forward slashes
       are intentional** - if you get a permission denied error it is because 
       the path is wrong, not the slashes):

       .. parsed-literal::

           omero=> SET client_encoding = 'UTF8';
           omero=> \\i C:/OMERO.server/|current_dbver|.sql
           ...
           ...
           omero=> \\q

-   Before starting the OMERO.server, you should run the OMERO diagnostics
    script so that you check that all of the settings are correct, e.g.

    ::

        C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero admin diagnostics

    The diagnostic tool may say that psql is not found. This should not be a
    problem but you can fix it by adding its bin folder to the path. For 
    example,
    :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PostgreSQL\\9.3\\bin`. Remember to reboot 
    after changing the environment.

-   You can now start the server using:

    ::

        C:\OMERO.server> bin\omero admin start
        Creating C:\OMERO.server\var\master
        Creating C:\OMERO.server\var\registry
        No descriptor given. Using etc\grid\windefault.xml
        Installing OMERO.master Windows service.
        Successfully installed OMERO.master Windows service.
        Starting OMERO.master Windows service.
        Waiting on startup. Use CTRL-C to exit
        ...

    If you have chosen a non-default install directory (other than
    :file:`C:\\OMERO.server`), the output will look like this:

    ::

        C:\OMERO.server> bin\omero admin start
        Found default value: C:\OMERO.server\var\master
        Attempting to correct...
        Converting from C:\OMERO.server to C:\OMERO.server
        Changes made: 6
        No descriptor given. Using etc\\grid\\windefault.xml
        ...

-  If you would like to move the directory again, see
   ``bin\winconfig.bat --help``, which gets called automatically on an
   initial install.

-  You can now test that you can log-in as "root", either with the
   OMERO.insight client or command-line:

   ::

       C:\OMERO.server> bin\omero login
       Server: [localhost]
       Username: [root]
       Password:         # root_password

JVM memory settings
-------------------

The OMERO server starts a number of Java services. Memory settings
for these are calculated on a system-by-system basis. An attempt
has been made to have usable settings out of the box, but if you
can afford to provide OMERO with more memory, it will certainly
improve your overall performance. See :ref:`jvm_memory_settings`
on how to tune the JVM.

OMERO.web and administration
----------------------------

.. note:: In order to deploy OMERO.web in a production environment such as 
    IIS please follow the instructions under :doc:`install-web`.

Otherwise, the internal Django webserver can be used for evaluation and 
development. In this case, you need to
turn debugging on, in order that static files can be served by Django:

::

    C:\OMERO.server> bin\omero config set omero.web.application_server development
    C:\OMERO.server> bin\omero config set omero.web.debug True

then start by

::

    c:\OMERO.server> bin\omero web start
    INFO:__main__:Application Starting...
    INFO:root:Processing custom settings for module omeroweb.settings
    ...
    Validating models...

    0 errors found
    Django version 1.6, using settings 'omeroweb.settings'
    Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:4080/
    Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.

.. note::  As OMERO.web 5 is based on Django 1.6,
    :property:`omero.web.session_engine` and :property:`omero.web.caches` should be
    unset.
    
    ::

        C:\omero_dist>bin\omero config set omero.web.session_engine
        C:\omero_dist>bin\omero config set omero.web.caches

    If your deployment requires additional cache store please follow
    :djangodoc:`Django documentation <topics/cache/>`
    for more details.

Once you have deployed and started the server you can use your browser
to access the OMERO.web interface:

-  `http://localhost:4080/ <http://localhost:4080/>`_

Post-installation items
-----------------------

Backup
^^^^^^

One of your first steps after putting your OMERO server into production
should be deciding on when and how you are going to :doc:`backup your
database and binary data </sysadmins/server-backup-and-restore>`. Please do 
not omit this step.

Security
^^^^^^^^

You should read the :doc:`/sysadmins/server-security` 
page to get a good idea as to what you need to do to get OMERO clients
speaking to your newly installed OMERO.server in accordance with your
institution or company's security policy.

Advanced configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have the base server running, you may want to try enabling some
of the advanced features such as :doc:`/sysadmins/dropbox` or :doc:`/sysadmins/server-ldap`.
If you have ***Flex data***, you may want to watch :snapshot:`the HCS configuration screencast <movies/omero-4-1/mov/FlexPreview4.1-configuration.mov>`.
See the :omero_plone:`Feature list <feature-list>` for more advanced
features you may want to use, and :doc:`/sysadmins/config` on how to get the
most out of your server.

If your users are going to be importing many files in one go, for example
multiple plates, you should make sure you set the maximum number of open files
to a sensible level (i.e. at least 8K for production systems, 16K for bigger
machines). See :ref:`ulimit` for more information.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you encounter a problem which is not addressed by the
:doc:`/sysadmins/troubleshooting` page, you can post a
message to our :mailinglist:`ome-users` mailing list as discussed on the
:doc:`/users/community-resources` page. Especially the
:ref:`server_fails_to_start` and :ref:`remote_clients_cannot_connect`
sections are a good starting point.

OMERO diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please include the output of the diagnostics command when asking for help with
your server installation:

Update notification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your OMERO.server installation will check for updates each time it is started
from the *Open Microscopy Environment* update server. If you wish to disable
this functionality you should do so now as outlined on the
:doc:`/sysadmins/UpgradeCheck` page.
