OMERO.web deployment
====================

OMERO.web is the web application component of the OMERO platform which
allows for the management, visualization (in a fully multi-dimensional
image viewer) and annotation of images from a web browser. It also
includes OMERO.webadmin for managing users and groups.


OMERO.web is an integral part of the OMERO platform and can be deployed
with:

-  IIS 5.1, 6.0 or 7.0 on Microsoft Windows (since OMERO 4.2.1)
-  FastCGI using a FastCGI capable web server such as
   `Apache <http://httpd.apache.org/>`_ (with
   `mod\_fastcgi <http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/>`_ enabled),
   `nginx <http://nginx.org/>`_ or
   `lighttpd <http://www.lighttpd.net/>`_ (since OMERO 4.2.1)
-  The built-in Django lightweight development server (for **testing**
   only)

You can find more information about FastCGI and where to get modules or
packages for your distribution on the
`FastCGI website <http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/node/3>`_.

If you need help configuring your firewall rules, see the :doc:`/sysadmins/server-security` page.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  OMERO and its prerequisites (see :doc:`server-installation`).

-  Python 2 (2.6 or later)

   -  `Pillow`_ should be available for your distribution

   -  Matplotlib_ should be available for your distribution

-  A FastCGI capable web server

Quick start
-----------

.. _using_iis:

Using IIS
~~~~~~~~~

Once you have IIS installed on your system, a straightforward set of
steps is required to get the `ISAPI
WSGI <http://code.google.com/p/isapi-wsgi/>`_ handler for OMERO.web
working with your IIS deployment.

-  Ensure that the ISAPI for IIS options are installed
-  Download and install `an ISAPI
   WSGI Installer <http://code.google.com/p/isapi-wsgi/downloads/list>`_ (we
   suggest the *Windows Installer*)
-  For extended compatibility with multiple IIS versions ISAPI WSGI uses
   the IIS 5/6 WMI interface to interact with your IIS deployment. If
   you are using IIS 7 you must enable the IIS 6 WMI backwards
   compatibility options, as shown on the figure:

.. figure:: /images/installation-images/IIS7Requirements.png

   :width: 35%
   :alt: IIS 7 configuration options

   IIS 7 configuration options

-  The :guilabel:`Advanced Settings...` for the application pool
   assigned to your default site require modification using the *IIS Manager* as follows:

   - :guilabel:`Enable 32-bit Applications` - OMERO.web and the ISAPI_WSGI x32 installer
     are 32-bit applications on Windows at present. If you are attempting
     to run OMERO.web on a 64-bit version of Windows and you installed ISAPI_WSGI with the
     x32 windows installer as we recommended above, you must enable 32-bit
     compatibility.  If you downloaded the ISAPI_WSGI 'source distribution'
     and compiled ISAPI_WSGI yourself, e.g. if you are using x64 Python, you
     do not need to make this change, and should leave the "Enable 32-Bit Applications"
     value at it's default value of False.
     
   - :guilabel:`Idle Time-out (minutes)` - to stop the worker process from
     suspending during inactivity periods, this setting needs to be
     changed to 0.

-  To avoid rendering errors on OMERO.web it is recomended to add the custom
   HTTP response header in the Web site pane.

   :align: center
   :alt: IIS 7 HTTP response header

-  Configure OMERO.web bindings for IIS

   ::

       C:\omero_dist>bin\omero web iis

   .. note::  As OMERO.web 5 is based on Django 1.6,
       :property:`omero.web.session_engine` and 
       :property:`omero.web.caches` should be unset.

       ::

           C:\omero_dist>bin\omero config set omero.web.session_engine
           C:\omero_dist>bin\omero config set omero.web.caches

       If your deployment requires additional cache store please follow 
       `Django documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/cache/>`_
       for more details.

-  OMERO.web is configured to use FastCGI TCP by default. If you are using a
   non-standard web server configuration you may wish to change
   :property:`omero.web.application_server`:

   ::

       C:\omero_dist>bin\omero config set omero.web.application_server "fastcgi" / "fastcgi-tcp"


Logging in to OMERO.web
-----------------------

Once you have deployed and started the server, you can use your browser
to access OMERO.webadmin or the OMERO.webclient:

-  **http://your\_host/omero** OR, for development server:
   **http://localhost:4080**

   OMERO.webadmin login

.. note::
	This starts the server in the foreground. It is your
	responsibility to place it in the background, if required, and
	manage its shutdown.


OMERO.web Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Session cookies :property:`omero.web.session_expire_at_browser_close`:

   -  A boolean that determines whether to expire the session when the user
      closes their browser. See `Django Browser-length sessions vs. persistent
      sessions documentation 
      <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/http/sessions/#browser-length-vs-persistent-sessions>`_
      for more details. Default: ``True``.

      ::

          C:\omero_dist>bin\omero config set omero.web.session_expire_at_browser_close "True"

   -  The age of session cookies, in seconds. Default: ``86400``.

      ::

          C:\omero_dist>bin\omero config set omero.web.session_cookie_age 86400

-  Session engine:

   -  Each session for a logged-in user in OMERO.web is kept in the session 
      store. Stale sessions can cause the store to grow with time. OMERO.web 
      uses by default the OS file system as the session store backend and 
      does not automatically purge stale sessions, see 
      `Django file-based session documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/http/sessions/#using-file-based-sessions>`_
      for more details. It is therefore the responsibility of the OMERO 
      administrator to purge the session cache using the provided management 
      command:

      ::

          C:\omero_dist>bin\omero web clearsessions

      It is recommended to call this command on a regular basis, for example 
      as a daily cron job, see 
      `Django clearing the session store documentation  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/http/sessions/#clearing-the-session-store>`_
      for more information.

      .. note::
          OMERO.web offers alternative session backends to automatically 
          delete stale data using the cache session store backend, see
          `Django cached session documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/http/sessions/#using-cached-sessions>`_
          for more details. After installing all the cache prerequisites set the following:

          ::

              C:\omero_dist>bin\omero config set omero.web.caches '{"default": { "BACKEND": "django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache", "LOCATION": "127.0.0.1:11211", "TIMEOUT": "86400" } }'
              C:\omero_dist>bin\omero config set omero.web.session_engine django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache
