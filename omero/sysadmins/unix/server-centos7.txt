OMERO.server installation on CentOS 7
=====================================

This is an example walkthrough for installing OMERO on CentOS 7, using
a dedicated system user, and should be read in conjunction with
:doc:`install-web`. You can use this as a guide
for setting up your own test server. For production use you should also read
the pages listed under :ref:`index-optimizing-server`.

Example shell scripts for installing OMERO are included in-line, and can be
downloaded.
These instructions assume your Linux distribution is configured with a UTF-8
locale (this is normally the default).

For convenience in this walkthrough the main OMERO configuration options have
been defined as environment variables. When following this walkthrough you can
either use your own values, or alternatively source the following file:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/settings.env
   :start-after: Substitute

:download:`settings.env <walkthrough/settings.env>`


Prerequisites
-------------

**The following steps are run as root.**


Install Ice, Java, PostgreSQL::

  yum -y install epel-release

  curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/zeroc-ice-el7.repo \
  http://download.zeroc.com/Ice/3.5/el7/zeroc-ice-el7.repo

  yum -y install \
    unzip \
    wget \
    java-1.8.0-openjdk \
    ice ice-python ice-servers

  yum -y install \
    python-pip python-devel python-virtualenv \
    numpy scipy python-matplotlib python-tables

  # upgrade pip to run 7.1.2
  pip install --upgrade pip

  # install Pillow via pip
  yum -y install \
    zlib-devel \
    libjpeg-devel \
    gcc

  # Cap Pillow version due to a limitation in OMERO.figure with v3.0.0
  pip install 'Pillow<3.0'

  # Django
  pip install 'Django>=1.8,<1.9'

  # Postgres, reconfigure to allow TCP connections
  yum -y install http://yum.postgresql.org/9.4/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos94-9.4-2.noarch.rpm
  yum -y install postgresql94-server postgresql94

  PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS=--encoding=UTF8 /usr/pgsql-9.4/bin/postgresql94-setup initdb
  sed -i.bak -re 's/^(host.*)ident/\1md5/' /var/lib/pgsql/9.4/data/pg_hba.conf

  systemctl start postgresql-9.4.service
  systemctl enable postgresql-9.4.service

Create an omero system user, and a directory for the OMERO repository:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step02_all_setup.sh

:download:`step02_all_setup.sh <walkthrough/step02_all_setup.sh>`


Create a database user and initialize a new database for OMERO:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step03_all_postgres.sh

:download:`step03_all_postgres.sh <walkthrough/step03_all_postgres.sh>`


Installing OMERO.server
-----------------------

**The following steps are run as the omero system user.**

Download, unzip and configure OMERO, and create a
configuration file for Nginx. The rest of this walkthrough assumes the
OMERO.server is installed into the home directory of the omero system user.

Note that this script requires the same environment variables that were set
earlier in `settings.env`, so you may need to copy and/or source this file as
the omero user.

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step04_all_omero.sh

| :download:`step04_all_omero.sh <walkthrough/step04_all_omero.sh>`

Installing a web server
-----------------------

To Deploy OMERO.web, you can use either Nginx or Apache.
Follow the steps to install your chosen web server.

Nginx
^^^^^

**The following steps are run as root.**

Install Nginx, copy the Nginx OMERO configuration file into the
Nginx configuration directory, and disable the default configuration:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step05_centos7_nginx.sh

| :download:`step05_centos7_nginx.sh <walkthrough/step05_centos7_nginx.sh>`

Apache
^^^^^^

As the **omero** system user, configure OMERO.web:
  
.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/setup_omero_apache24.sh

| :download:`setup_omero_apache24.sh <walkthrough/setup_omero_apache24.sh>`

**The following steps are run as root.**

Install Apache 2.4::

	yum -y install httpd mod_wsgi

Copy the Apache OMERO configuration file into the
Apache configuration directory::

    cp ~omero/OMERO.server/apache.conf.tmp /etc/httpd/conf.d/omero-web.conf

    rm -rf /run/httpd/* /tmp/httpd*

    systemctl enable httpd.service
    systemctl start httpd

| :download:`step05_centos7_apache24.sh <walkthrough/step05_centos7_apache24.sh>`

Running OMERO
-------------

**The following steps are run as the omero system user.**

OMERO should now be set up. To start the server run::

    OMERO.server/bin/omero admin start

To start the OMERO.web client run::

    OMERO.server/bin/omero web start

Nginx or Apache should already be running so you should be able to log in as the OMERO
root user by going to http://localhost/ in your web browser.
Please read the SELinux_ section below.

In addition some example `init.d` scripts are available should you wish to
start OMERO and OMERO.web automatically:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step06_centos6_daemon.sh

| :download:`step06_centos6_daemon.sh
  <walkthrough/step06_centos6_daemon.sh>`
| :download:`omero-init.d <walkthrough/omero-init.d>`
| :download:`omero-web-init.d <walkthrough/omero-web-init.d>`


Securing OMERO
--------------

**The following steps are run as root.**

If multiple users have access to the machine running OMERO you should restrict
access to OMERO.server's configuration and runtime directories, and optionally
the OMERO data directory:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step07_all_perms.sh

| :download:`step07_all_perms.sh <walkthrough/step07_all_perms.sh>`


Regular tasks
-------------

**The following steps are run as root.**

The default OMERO.web session handler uses temporary files to store sessions
which should be deleted at regular intervals, for instance by creating a cron
job:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/omero-web-cron

Copy this script into the appropriate location:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step08_all_cron.sh

| :download:`omero-web-cron <walkthrough/omero-web-cron>`
| :download:`step08_all_cron.sh <walkthrough/step08_all_cron.sh>`


.. _SELinux_centos7:

SELinux
-------

**The following steps are run as root.**

If you are running a system with
`SELinux enabled <http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SELinux>`_
and are unable to access OMERO.web you may need to adjust the security policy:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/setup_centos_selinux.sh

| :download:`setup_centos_selinux.sh <walkthrough/setup_centos_selinux.sh>`
