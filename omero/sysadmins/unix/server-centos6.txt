OMERO.server installation on CentOS 6 with Python 2.7 and Ice 3.5
=================================================================

This installation walkthrough should be read in conjunction with
:doc:`server-installation` and :doc:`install-web`.

Running OMERO on CentOS 6 has a number of special requirements which
deviate from the standard installation instructions. The instructions
below will set up Python 2.7 and Ice 3.5 on CentOS 6. We tested the
installation with Python 2.7 from `IUS <https://ius.io/>`_ and used
a `virtual environment <https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
to install the various dependencies required to install an OMERO.server.
It is also possible to use SCL Python (for example 
:download:`install_centos6_py27_nginx.sh <walkthrough/install_centos6_py27_nginx.sh>`) but such solution could have
potential side effects.

Python 2.7
----------

CentOS 6 provides Python 2.6. However, OMERO.web requires Python 2.7
in order to use `Django 1.8`. While `Django 1.6` may be used with Python
2.6, this version of Django no longer has security support.  In
consequence, it is necessary to upgrade to Python 2.7 in order to
obtain Django security updates, which are required for a production
deployment.

**The following steps are run as root.**


Install:

    yum install https://centos6.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
    yum install python27

Note that ``epel-release`` will be pulled as a dependency.

To use the newly installed version of Python, it is preferrable to
install the various dependencies required to run the
OMERO.server in a virtual environment.

If virtualenv is **not** already installed, install it using pip::

	yum install python27-pip
	pip2.7 install virtualenv

Development packages
--------------------

The following sections require a number of libraries and a compiler.
Run the following commands to install them::

    yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
    # Python module dependencies
    yum install python27-devel hdf5-devel freetype-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel


Ice 3.5
-------

The RPM packages provided by ZeroC for CentOS 6 use the Python 2.6
provided by the system. OMERO will need an Ice build which uses
Python 2.7. A version of Ice 3.5 built against Python 2.7 installed
above is available at http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/ice/experimental.

The following steps will install Ice into :file:`/opt`::

    # Download and install needed Ice build dependencies (db and mcpp)
    curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/zeroc-ice-el6.repo http://download.zeroc.com/Ice/3.5/el6/zeroc-ice-el6.repo
    mkdir /tmp/ice-download
    cd /tmp/ice-download
    wget http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/ice/experimental/Ice-3.5.1-b1-centos6-iuspy27-x86_64.tar.gz
    yum install db53 db53-devel db53-utils mcpp-devel 
    tar -zxvf /tmp/ice-download/Ice-3.5.1-b1-centos6-iuspy27-x86_64.tar.gz
    mv Ice-3.5.1-b1-centos6-iuspy27-x86_64 /opt/Ice-3.5.1
    # make path to Ice globally accessible
    # if globally set, there is no need to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    echo /opt/Ice-3.5.1/lib64 > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ice-x86_64.conf
    ldconfig


Additional packages required by OMERO
-------------------------------------

Install Java::

    yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

Install PostgreSQL, reconfigure to allow TCP connections and start it::

    yum install http://yum.postgresql.org/9.4/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/pgdg-redhat94-9.4-1.noarch.rpm 
    yum install postgresql94-server postgresql94-contrib
    service postgresql-9.4 initdb
    sed -i.bak -re 's/^(host.*)ident/\1md5/' /var/lib/pgsql/9.4/data/pg_hba.conf
    chkconfig postgresql-9.4 on
    service postgresql-9.4 start

For the steps described above, download: 

| :download:`step01_centos6_py27_ius_deps.sh <walkthrough/step01_centos6_py27_ius_deps.sh>`

Setting up the OMERO.server
---------------------------
This is an example walkthrough for installing OMERO on CentOS 6 with Python 2.7 using
a dedicated system user.
You can use this as a guide for setting up your own test server. For production use you should also read the pages listed under :ref:`index-optimizing-server`.

For convenience in this walkthrough the main OMERO configuration options have
been defined as environment variables. When following this walkthrough you can
either use your own values, or alternatively source the following file :download:`settings.env <walkthrough/settings.env>`:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/settings.env
   :start-after: Substitute

Once Python 2.7, Ice 3.5 and the additional packages are installed:

Create an omero system user, and a directory for the OMERO repository:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step02_all_setup.sh

| :download:`step02_all_setup.sh <walkthrough/step02_all_setup.sh>`


Create a database user and initialize a new database for OMERO:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step03_all_postgres.sh

| :download:`step03_all_postgres.sh <walkthrough/step03_all_postgres.sh>`

To install the remaining dependencies, create a virtual environment::

	virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 /home/omero/omeroenv
	source /home/omero/omeroenv/bin/activate
	#upgrade pip
	/home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip


The following settings will need adding to your OMERO startup script
or to the omero user's environment (for example in a shell startup
script). Add the absolute path to the :file:`bin` directory of 
the virtual environment :file:`/home/omero/omeroenv` to the ``PATH``
variable:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/omero-centos6py27ius.env

These settings will enable Python 2.7, and set the necessary
environment variables for Ice 3.5 to work.
For example, download :download:`walkthrough/omero-centos6py27ius.env 
<walkthrough/omero-centos6py27ius.env>` into ``/home/omero`` and run::

    echo source /home/omero/omero-centos6py27ius.env >> /home/omero/.bashrc


Install additional Python modules in the virtual environment::

    # Cap Pillow version due to a limitation in OMERO.figure
    /home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip2.7 install "Pillow<3.0"
    /home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip2.7 install numpy matplotlib

    # Install Django
    /home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip2.7 install "Django>=1.8,<1.9"

Install the OMERO.server
------------------------

**The following steps are run as the omero system user.**

Download, unzip and configure OMERO, and create a
configuration file for Nginx. The rest of this walkthrough assumes the
OMERO.server is installed into the home directory of this user.

Note that this script requires the same environment variables that were set
earlier in `settings.env`, so you may need to copy and/or source this file as
the omero user.

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step04_all_omero.sh

To Deploy OMERO.web, you can use either Nginx or Apache. Follow the steps to install your chosen web server.

Installing Nginx
----------------

See also :doc:`install-web/install-nginx`.

**The following steps are run as root.**

To install Nginx run::
	
	yum install nginx

In the virtual environment, install the requirements to run OMERO.web using the requirements file::

	/home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip2.7 install -r ~omero/OMERO.server/share/web/requirements-py27-nginx.txt

Deactivate the virtual environment::

    deactivate

Copy the Nginx OMERO configuration file into the Nginx configuration directory, and disable the default configuration and start Nginx::

    mv /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.disabled
    cp ~omero/OMERO.server/nginx.conf.tmp /etc/nginx/conf.d/omero-web.conf
    service nginx start

Installing Apache
-----------------

See also :doc:`install-web/install-apache`.

**The following steps are run as root.**

The version of Apache installed is 2.2, see the note below if you wish to use
version 2.4.

To install Apache 2.2 run::
	
    yum install httpd
    # install mod_wsgi compiled against Python 2.7
    yum install python27-mod_wsgi

In the virtual environment, install the requirements to run OMERO.web using the requirements file::

    /home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip2.7 install -r ~omero/OMERO.server/share/web/requirements-py27-apache.txt

**The following steps are run as the omero system user.**

Configure OMERO.web:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/setup_omero_apache22.sh


As **root**, deactivate the virtual environment::

    deactivate

Open the Apache OMERO configuration file i.e. :file:`omero/OMERO.server/apache.conf.tmp`, and add the line below to the ``python-path`` parameter of ``WSGIDaemonProcess``::

	/home/omero/omeroenv/lib64/python2.7/site-packages


Copy the Apache OMERO configuration file into the Apache configuration directory
and start Apache::

	cp ~omero/OMERO.server/apache.conf.tmp /etc/httpd/conf.d/omero-web.conf

	chkconfig httpd on
	service httpd start


.. note:: If you wish to use Apache 2.4 with mod_wsgi, see :download:`docker_virtualenv_ius_apache24.sh <walkthrough/docker_virtualenv_ius_apache24.sh>` for a possible solution.


Final tasks
-----------

The installation should now be complete.
To run OMERO, secure OMERO and perform regular tasks, please read the
relevant sections of :doc:`server-linux-walkthrough`.

Installing Web apps
-------------------

It is possible to add Web applications to OMERO. If your app required some extra Python packages installed
using ``pip``, those packages should be also installed in the virtual environment. For example,
`OMERO.figure <http://figure.openmicroscopy.org/>`_ requires ``reportlab`` and ``markdown``::

    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 /home/omero/omeroenv
    source /home/omero/omeroenv/bin/activate
    /home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip2.7 install reportlab markdown
