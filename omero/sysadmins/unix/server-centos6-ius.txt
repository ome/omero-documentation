Installing Python 2.7 and Ice 3.5 on CentOS 6
=============================================

Running OMERO on CentOS 6 has a number of special requirements which
deviate from the standard installation instructions.  The instructions
below will set up Python 2.7 and Ice 3.5 on CentOS 6. We tested the
installation with Python 2.7 from `IUS <https://ius.io/>`_ and used
a `virtual environment <https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_. 

Python 2.7
----------

CentOS 6 provides Python 2.6.  However, OMERO.web requires Python 2.7
in order to use django 1.8.  While django 1.6 may be used with Python
2.6, this version of django no longer has security support.  In
consequence, it is necessary to upgrade to Python 2.7 in order to
obtain django security updates, which are required for a production
deployment.

As root, run::

	yum install https://centos6.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
    yum install python27

Note that ``epel-release``` will be pulled as a dependency.

To use this version of Python, it is preferrable to install
the various dependencies in a virtual environment. 
If virtualenv is not already installed, install it using pip run::

	yum install python27-pip
	pip2.7 install virtualenv

To demonstrate its use::

    $ python --version
    Python 2.6.6
    $ virtualenv /home/omero/omeroenv
    $ source /home/omero/omeroenv/bin/activate
    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.10
    $ deactivate # back to the default python

Development packages
--------------------

The following sections require a number of libraries and a compiler.
Run the following commands to install them::

    yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
    # Ice dependencies
    yum install expat-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel zlib-devel
    # Python module dependencies
    yum install hdf5-devel freetype-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel


Ice 3.5
-------

The RPM packages provided by ZeroC for CentOS 6 use the Python 2.6
provided by the system.  OMERO will need an Ice build which uses
Python 2.7. A version of Ice 3.5 built using Python 2.7 installed
above is available at http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/ice/experimental.

The following steps will install Ice into :file:`/opt`::

    # Download and install needed Ice build dependencies (db and mcpp)
    curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/zeroc-ice-el6.repo http://download.zeroc.com/Ice/3.5/el6/zeroc-ice-el6.repo
    mkdir /tmp/ice-download
    cd /tmp/ice-download
    wget http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/ice/experimental/Ice-3.5.1-b1-centos6-iuspy27-x86_64.tar.gz
    yum install db53 db53-devel db53-utils mcpp-devel 
    tar -zxvf /tmp/ice-download/Ice-3.5.1-b1-centos6-iuspy27-x86_64.tar.gz
    mv Ice-3.5.1-b1-centos6-iuspy27-x86_64 /opt/Ice-3.5.1

Additional packages required by OMERO
-------------------------------------

Install Java::

    yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

Install and start PostgreSQL::

    yum install http://yum.postgresql.org/9.4/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/pgdg-redhat94-9.4-1.noarch.rpm 
    yum install postgresql94-server postgresql94-contrib
    service postgresql-9.4 initdb
    chkconfig postgresql-9.4 on
    service postgresql-9.4 start

Setting up the OMERO.server
---------------------------
This is an example walkthrough for installing OMERO on Centos6 with Python 2.7using
a dedicated system user.
You can use this as a guide for setting up your own test server. For production use you should also read the pages listed under :ref:`index-optimizing-server`.

For convenience in this walkthrough the main OMERO configuration options have
been defined as environment variables. When following this walkthrough you can
either use your own values, or alternatively source the following file:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/settings.env
   :start-after: Substitute

:download:`settings.env <walkthrough/settings.env>`

Once Python2.7, Ice3.5 and the additional packages are installed,

Create an omero system user, and a directory for the OMERO repository:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step02_all_setup.sh

:download:`step02_all_setup.sh <walkthrough/step02_all_setup.sh>`


Create a database user and initialize a new database for OMERO:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step03_all_postgres.sh

:download:`step03_all_postgres.sh <walkthrough/step03_all_postgres.sh>`


To use Nginx, as **root**, run::
	
	yum install nginx

To use Apache 2.4, as **root**, run::
	
	yum install httpd24u

The instructions below assume that virtualenv has been installed
using pip2.7.

Create a virtual environment::

	virtualenv /home/omero/omeroenv
	source /home/omero/omeroenv/bin/activate


The following settings will need adding to your OMERO startup script
or to the OMERO user's environment (for example in a shell startup
script). Add the absolute path to the :file:`bin` directory of 
the virtual environment :file:`/home/omero/omeroenv` to the ``PATH``
variable::

    ICE_HOME=/opt/Ice-3.5.1
    PATH="${ICE_HOME}/bin:/home/omero/omeroenv/bin:$PATH"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${ICE_HOME}/lib64:${ICE_HOME}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    export PYTHONPATH="${ICE_HOME}/python:$PYTHONPATH"
    export SLICEPATH="${ICE_HOME}/slice"

These settings will enable Python 2.7, and set the necessary
environment variables for Ice 3.5 to work.	

Install additional Python modules::

	/home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip2.7 install pillow numpy matplotlib

Install Django::

	/home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip2.7 install "Django>=1.8,<1.9"

To use Nginx, install Gunicorn::

	/home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip2.7 install gunicorn

To use Apache 2.4, install mod_wsgi::

	/home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip2.7 install mod_wsgi-httpd
	/home/omero/omeroenv/bin/pip2.7 install mod_wsgi

Install the OMERO.server

As the **omero** system user download, unzip and configure OMERO, and create a
configuration file for Nginx. The rest of this walkthrough assumes the
OMERO.server is installed into the home directory of this user.

Note that this script requires the same environment variables that were set
earlier in `settings.env`, so you may need to copy and/or source this file as
the omero user.

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/step04_all_omero.sh

:download:`step04_all_omero.sh <walkthrough/step04_all_omero.sh>`

Copy the Nginx OMERO configuration file into the Nginx configuration directory, and disable the default configuration::

	mv /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.disabled
	cp ~omero/OMERO.server/nginx.conf.tmp /etc/nginx/conf.d/omero-web.conf

To use Apache 2.4, run:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/setup_omero_apache24.sh

:download:`setup_omero_apache24.sh <walkthrough/setup_omero_apache24.sh>`

Open the Apache OMERO configuration file i.e. :file:`omero/OMERO.server/apache.conf.tmp`, and add to the ``python-path`` parameter of ``WSGIDaemonProcess``::

	/home/omero/omeroenv/lib64/python2.7/site-packages

Copy the Apache OMERO configuration file into the Apache confiuration directory,
and create a configuration file for ``wsgi``::

	cp ~omero/OMERO.server/apache.conf.tmp /etc/httpd/conf.d/omero-web.conf
	cat << EOF > /etc/httpd/conf.d/wsgi.conf
	LoadModule wsgi_module /home/omero/omeroenv/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/mod_wsgi/server/mod_wsgi-py27.so
	EOF

	chkconfig httpd on
	service httpd start
