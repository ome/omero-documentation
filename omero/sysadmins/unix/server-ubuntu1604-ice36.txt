OMERO.server installation on Ubuntu 16.04 and Ice 3.6
=====================================================

This is an example walkthrough for installing OMERO on Ubuntu 16.04, using
a dedicated system user, and should be read in conjunction with
:doc:`install-web`. You can use this as a guide
for setting up your own test server. For production use you should also read
the pages listed under :ref:`index-optimizing-server`.

These instructions assume your Linux distribution is configured with a UTF-8
locale (this is normally the default).

For convenience in this walkthrough the main OMERO configuration options have
been defined as environment variables. When following this walkthrough you can
either use your own values, or alternatively source the following file:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/settings.env
   :start-after: Substitute

:download:`settings.env <walkthrough/settings.env>`


Installing prerequisites
------------------------

**The following steps are run as root.**

Install Java 1.8, Ice 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.4:

To install Java 1.8 and other dependencies:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/walkthrough_ubuntu1604.sh
    :start-after: #start-step01
    :end-before: # install Ice

To install Ice 3.6:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/walkthrough_ubuntu1604.sh
    :start-after: #start-supported-ice
    :end-before: #end-supported-ice

To install PostgreSQL 9.4:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/walkthrough_ubuntu1604.sh
    :start-after: #end-supported-ice
    :end-before: #end-step01

See :download:`requirements.txt<walkthrough/requirements.txt>`

Create an omero system user, and a directory for the OMERO repository:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/walkthrough_ubuntu1604.sh
    :start-after: #start-step02
    :end-before: #end-step02


Create a database user and initialize a new database for OMERO:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/walkthrough_ubuntu1604.sh
    :start-after: #start-step03
    :end-before: #end-step03


Installing OMERO.server
-----------------------

**The following steps are run as the omero system user.**

Download, unzip and configure OMERO. The rest of this walkthrough assumes the
OMERO.server is installed into the home directory of the omero system user.

Note that this script requires the same environment variables that were set
earlier in `settings.env`, so you may need to copy and/or source this file as
the omero user.

You will need to install the server corresponding to your Ice version.

Install ``server-ice36.zip``:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/walkthrough_ubuntu1604.sh
    :start-after: #start-release-ice36
    :end-before: #end-release-ice36

Configure:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/walkthrough_ubuntu1604.sh
    :start-after: #end-release-ice36
    :end-before: #end-step04

Installing a web server
-----------------------
OMERO.web is deployed using Nginx see :doc:`install-web/install-nginx`.

**The following steps are run as root.**

Install Nginx 1.8, copy the Nginx OMERO configuration file into the
Nginx configuration directory, and disable the default configuration:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/walkthrough_ubuntu1404.sh
    :start-after: #start-nginx
    :end-before: #end-nginx


Running OMERO
-------------

**The following steps are run as the omero system user.**

OMERO should now be set up. To start the server run::

    OMERO.server/bin/omero admin start

To start the OMERO.web client run::

    OMERO.server/bin/omero web start

Nginx should already be running so you should be able to log in as the OMERO
root user by going to http://localhost/ in your web browser.

In addition some example `init.d` scripts are available should you wish to
start OMERO and OMERO.web automatically:

| :download:`omero-init.d <walkthrough/omero-init.d>`
| :download:`omero-web-init.d <walkthrough/omero-web-init.d>`


Securing OMERO
--------------

**The following steps are run as root.**

If multiple users have access to the machine running OMERO you should restrict
access to OMERO.server's configuration and runtime directories, and optionally
the OMERO data directory:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/walkthrough_ubuntu1604.sh
    :start-after: #start-step07
    :end-before: #end-step07

Regular tasks
-------------

**The following steps are run as root.**

The default OMERO.web session handler uses temporary files to store sessions
which should be deleted at regular intervals, for instance by creating a cron
job:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/walkthrough_ubuntu1604.sh
    :start-after: #start-omeroweb-cron
    :end-before: #end-omeroweb-cron

Copy the following commands into the appropriate location:

.. literalinclude:: walkthrough/walkthrough_ubuntu1604.sh
    :start-after: #start-copy-omeroweb-cron
    :end-before: #end-copy-omeroweb-cron

| :download:`omero-web-cron <walkthrough/omero-web-cron>`
