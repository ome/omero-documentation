OMERO.server Mac OS X installation walk-through with Homebrew
=============================================================


.. topic:: Overview

    This walk-through demonstrates how to install OMERO on a clean Mac
    OS X 10.7 Lion system using Homebrew.  Note that this demonstrates
    how to install OMERO.server *from the source code* via Homebrew, in
    addition to all its prerequisites. **The default instructions for UNIX
    platforms in the** :doc:`server-installation` **guide are all you need to
    install the prerequisites with Homebrew and then install the server zip
    from the downloads page.**

The instructions provided here depend on Homebrew 0.9 or later, including
support for the ``brew tap`` command. These instructions are implemented in an
:source:`automated script <docs/hudson/OMERO-homebrew-install.sh>` which
installs OMERO via Homebrew from a fresh configuration.

Prerequisites
-------------

OS X/Xcode
^^^^^^^^^^

.. _OS X Developer Tools: https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/

Install the `OS X Developer Tools`_. This procedure is regularly tested with
the following configuration:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 30, 10,10

    - * Model Identifier
      * Mac OS X version
      * Xcode version

    - * MacBookPro8,2 (Intel Core i7, 2.3 GHz, 8 GB RAM)
      * 10.7.5
      * 4.6

.. note::

    For Xcode 4.x, make sure that the Command line tools are installed
    (:menuselection:`Preferences --> Downloads --> Components`)


Java (>=1.6)
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need Java which comes as standard on OS X.

::

    $ java -version
    java version "1.6.0_33"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_33-b03-424-11M3720)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.8-b03-424, mixed mode)

Homebrew
^^^^^^^^

.. _`Homebrew wiki`: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation

Follow the installation instructions on the `Homebrew wiki`_. All
requirements for OMERO will be installed to :file:`/usr/local`.

::

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go/install)"
    $ brew install git

If you are having issues with curl, see the :ref:`install_homebrew_curl`
section under :ref:`install_homebrew_common_issues`.

The installation of OMERO via Homebrew depends on two alternate repositories
containing extra formulas: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science for
the HDF5 formula and https://github.com/ome/homebrew-alt for all the
OME-provided formulas and older versions of Ice.

Python 2 (>=2.6)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Homebrew and Python`: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-and-Python

You can install OMERO using either the system-wide Python or the Python
provided by Homebrew. For a more thorough description of the latter solution,
look at the `Homebrew and Python`_ page. Note that the automated script linked
above tests the OMERO installation using the Homebrew Python.

If using system-wide Python, check it is installed and its version.

::

    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.3

To install the Python provided by Homebrew::

	$ brew install python

Independently of the chosen Python, you can setup and use `virtual
environments <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>`_ to install the OMERO
Python dependencies (see :ref:`python_dependencies`).

.. note::
	The Homebrew formulas used below provide Python bindings. As described in
	`Homebrew and Python`_, you should NOT be in an active virtual environment
	when you ``brew install`` them.


OMERO installation
------------------

OMERO |release|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you just want a deployment of the |release| release of OMERO.server then a
simple Homebrew install is sufficient, e.g.

::

    $ brew tap homebrew/science
    $ brew tap ome/alt
    $ brew install omero

This should install OMERO along with most of the non-Python requirements.

The default version of Ice installed by the OMERO formula is Ice 3.5. To
install OMERO with Ice 3.4, use::

	$ brew install omero --with-ice34

or to install OMERO with Ice 3.3, use::

	$ brew install omero --with-ice33

Additional installation options can be listed using the ``info`` command:

::

    $ brew info omero

Development server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you wish to pull OMERO.server from the git repo for development purposes
then it is worth setting up OMERO.server manually. First use Homebrew to
install the OMERO dependencies:

::

    $ brew tap homebrew/science
    $ brew tap ome/alt
    $ brew install `brew deps omero`

The default version of Ice installed by the OMERO formula is Ice 3.5. To
install the OMERO dependencies with Ice 3.4, use::

	$ brew install `brew deps omero --with-ice34`

or to install the OMERO dependencies with Ice 3.3, use::

	$ brew install `brew deps omero --with-ice33`

Prepare a place for your OMERO code to live, e.g.

::

    $ mkdir -p ~/code/projects/OMERO
    $ cd ~/code/projects/OMERO

If you installed Ice 3.5, you will need to set :envvar:`SLICEPATH` to be
able to build the server, i.e.
``export SLICEPATH=/usr/local/share/Ice-3.5/slice``.

.. include:: development-server

Additional OMERO requirements
-----------------------------

PostgreSQL
^^^^^^^^^^

Install PostgreSQL if you do not have another PostgreSQL installation that you
can use.

::

    $ postgres --version            # Check if you have postgres
    postgres (PostgreSQL) 9.3.4
    $ brew install postgresql


.. _python_dependencies:

Python dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Python dependencies can be installed in the system-wide Python
site-packages, in the Homebrew Python site-packages or within a virtual
environment. If you are using the system-wide Python site-packages, you may
need to use ``sudo`` to install the dependencies. If you are using a virtual
environment, activate it before calling the Python dependencies installation
script.

If you installed OMERO using Homebrew, execute the ``omero_python_deps``
script::

    $ cd /usr/local
    $ bash bin/omero_python_deps

If you use a development server, execute the ``python_deps.sh`` script under
:file:`docs/install`::

    $ cd ~/code/projects/OMERO
    $ bash docs/install/python_deps.sh

If you encounter problems with the installation script, please take a look at
:ref:`install_homebrew_common_issues`.

Configuration
-------------

Environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edit your :file:`.profile` as appropriate. The following are indicators of
required entries and correspond to a Homebrew installation of OMERO |release|:

::

    export PYTHONPATH=$(brew --prefix omero)/lib/python
    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/lib/node_modules:$PATH

If you have installed Ice 3.3 or Ice 3.4, you will need to specify the path to
Ice Python and dynamic libraries::

     export PYTHONPATH=$(brew --prefix omero)/lib/python:$ICE_HOME/python
     export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ICE_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

where ``ICE_HOME`` needs to be replaced by ``$(brew --prefix zeroc-ice33)`` or ``$(brew --prefix zeroc-ice34)`` depending on your configuration.

.. note::
    If you have a local :file:`.bash_profile` file, it will override your
    :file:`.profile` configuration file.

.. note::
    On Mac OS X Lion, a version of PostgreSQL is already installed. If you get an error like the following:

    ::

        psql: could not connect to server: Permission denied
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/var/pgsql_socket/.s.PGSQL.5432"?

    make sure :file:`/usr/local/bin` is at the beginning of your
    :envvar:`PATH` (see also `this post <http://nextmarvel.net/blog/2011/09/brew-install-postgresql-on-os-x-lion/>`_).


Database creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start the PostgreSQL server.

::

    $ initdb /usr/local/var/postgres
    $ brew services start postgresql
    $ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres/ -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start

Create a user, a database and add the PL/pgSQL language to your database.

::

    $ createuser -P -D -R -S db_user
    Enter password for new role:       # db_password
    Enter it again:       # db_password
    $ createdb -O db_user omero_database
    $ createlang plpgsql omero_database

Check to make sure the database has been created.

::

    $ psql -h localhost -U db_user -l

This command should give similar output to the following:

::

                            List of databases

       Name         | Owner   | Encoding |  Collation  |    Ctype    | Access privileges
    ----------------+---------+----------+-------------+-------------+-------------------
     omero_database | db_user | UTF8     | en_GB.UTF-8 | en_GB.UTF-8 |
     postgres       | ome     | UTF8     | en_GB.UTF-8 | en_GB.UTF-8 |
     template0      | ome     | UTF8     | en_GB.UTF-8 | en_GB.UTF-8 | =c/ome           +
                    |         |          |             |             | ome=CTc/ome
     template1      | ome     | UTF8     | en_GB.UTF-8 | en_GB.UTF-8 | =c/ome           +
                    |         |          |             |             | ome=CTc/ome
    (4 rows)

OMERO.server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now tell OMERO.server about our database.

.. parsed-literal::

    $ omero config set omero.db.name omero_database
    $ omero config set omero.db.user db_user
    $ omero config set omero.db.pass db_password

    $ omero db script
    Please enter omero.db.version [OMERO\ |version|\ ]:
    Please enter omero.db.patch [0]:
    Please enter password for new OMERO root user:       # root_password
    Please re-enter password for new OMERO root user:      # root_password
    Saving to ~/OMERO\ |version|\ __0.sql

Then enter the name of the .sql (see last line above) in the next command, to create the database:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ psql -h localhost -U db_user omero_database < OMERO\ |version|\ __0.sql

Now create a location to store OMERO data, e.g.

::

    $ mkdir -p ~/var/OMERO.data

and tell OMERO.server this location:

::

    $ omero config set omero.data.dir ~/var/OMERO.data

We can inspect the OMERO.server configuration settings using:

::

    $ omero config get

Now start the OMERO.server

::

    $ omero admin start

Now connect to your OMERO.server using OMERO.insight with the following credentials:

::

    U: root
    P: root_password

OMERO.web
^^^^^^^^^

You can set up the internal development web server

::

    $ omero config set omero.web.application_server development
    $ omero config set omero.web.debug True

Then start the webserver with:

::

    $ omero web start
    Starting django development webserver...
    Validating models...
    0 errors found

    Django version 1.1.1, using settings 'omeroweb.settings'
    Development server is running at http://0.0.0.0:4080/
    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

.. _install_homebrew_common_issues:

Common issues
-------------

General considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you run into problems with Homebrew, you can always run:

::

    $ brew update
    $ brew doctor

Also, please check the Homebrew `Bug Fixing Checklist <https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Bug-Fixing-Checklist>`_.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of errors/warnings specific to the OMERO
installation. Some if not all of them could possibly be avoided by removing
any previous OMERO installation artifacts from your system.

.. _install_homebrew_curl:

curl (Mac 10.5 only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    curl: (60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
    error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed

Use ``export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1`` before running failing brew commands.

Xcode
^^^^^

::

    Warning: Xcode is not installed! Builds may fail!

Install Xcode using `Mac App store <https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/>`_.

Macports/Fink
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    Warning: It appears you have MacPorts or Fink installed.

Follow uninstall instructions from the `Macports guide <http://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.macports.uninstalling.html>`_.

PostgreSQL
^^^^^^^^^^

::

    ==> Installing postgresql dependency: readline
    Error: No such file or directory - /usr/bin/cc

For Xcode 4.3.2 make sure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed (see `comment <https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/10244#issuecomment-4013781>`_).

::

    Error: You must ``brew link ossp-uuid' before postgresql can be installed

Try:

::

    $ brew cleanup
    $ brew link ossp-uuid

Ice
^^^

::

    Error: Failed executing: cd cpp && make M PP_HOME=/Users/sebastien/apps/    OMERO.libs/Cellar/mcpp/2.7.2 DB_HOME=/Users/sebastien/apps/OMERO.libs/Cellar/berkeley-    db46/4.6.21 OPTIMIZE=yes prefix=/Users/sebastien/apps/OMERO.libs/Cellar/zeroc-ice33/3.3 embedded_runpath_prefix=/Users/sebastien/apps/OMERO.libs/Cellar/zeroc-ice33/3.3 install

We have had problems building ``zeroc-ice33`` under MacOS 10.7.3 and 10.6.8
(see :ticket:`8075`). You can try installing ``zeroc-ice34`` (Ice 3.4)
instead. If you decide to go with ``zeroc-ice33``, make sure that you do not
have :envvar:`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` set to an existing Ice's installation lib
directory path. In essence your ``.bash_profile`` shouldn't have any
OMERO-related environment variables set before executing the installation
script.

szip
^^^^

::

    ==> Installing hdf5 dependency: szip
    ==> Downloading http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/lib-external/szip/2.1/src/szip-2.1.tar.gz
    Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/szip-2.1.tar.gz
    Error: MD5 mismatch
    Expected: 902f831bcefb69c6b635374424acbead
    Got: 0d6a55bb7787f9ff8b9d608f23ef5be0
    Archive: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/szip-2.1.tar.gz
    (To retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.)

Manually remove the archived version located under
:file:`/Library/Caches/Homebrew` since the maintainer may have updated the
file.

numexpr (and other Python packages)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you encounter an issue related to numexpr complaining about NumPy having a
too low version number, verify that you have not before installed any Python
packages using pip. In the case where pip has been installed before homebrew,
uninstall it:

::

    $ sudo pip uninstall pip

After that try running ``python_deps.sh`` again. That should install ``pip``
via Homebrew and put the Python packages in correct folders.

gfortran
^^^^^^^^

``gfortran`` currently fails to build on 32-bit 10.6.8 machines (see https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/17776)
