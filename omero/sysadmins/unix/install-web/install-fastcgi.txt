OMERO.web FastCGI deployment (DEPRECATED)
=========================================

.. note::
    Deprecated since version 5.1.4: OMERO.web deployment using FastCGI
    is deprecated and will be removed in OMERO 5.2.
    Use :doc:`install-wsgi` as an alternative.


.. _fastcgi_configuration:

FastCGI Configuration (Unix/Linux)
----------------------------------

If you have installed Nginx or Apache OMERO can automatically generate a
configuration file for your web server, see :ref:`apache22_configuration`,
:ref:`apache24_configuration` or :ref:`nginx_configuration`.
The location of the file will depend on your system, please refer to your
web server's manual. See :ref:`customizing_your_omero_web_installation_unix`
for additional customization options.


.. _apache22_configuration:

Apache 2.2 configuration (mod_fastcgi)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install `mod\_fastcgi <http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/>`_.
To create a site configuration file for inclusion in the main Apache
configuration redirect the output of the following command into a file:

::

    $ bin/omero web config apache

.. literalinclude:: apache-omero.conf
   :lines: 55-

.. note::
    The default configuration file installed with `mod_fastcgi` may be
    incompatible with OMERO. In particular, the `FastCGIWrapper` option
    conflicts with `FastCGIExternalServer` required by OMERO and must be
    removed or commented out.

To configure an HTTPS server follow
`the Apache documentation <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_ssl.html>`_.


.. _apache24_configuration:

Apache 2.4+ configuration (mod_proxy_fcgi)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `mod\_proxy\_fcgi`, `mod\_proxy` and `mod\_rewrite` Apache modules should
already be installed and enabled as part of the Apache installation, if this
is not the case then enable them.
To create a site configuration file for inclusion in the main Apache
configuration redirect the output of the following command into a file:

::

    $ bin/omero web config apache-fcgi

.. literalinclude:: apache-fcgi-omero.conf
   :lines: 51-


.. _nginx_configuration:

Nginx FastCGI configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a site configuration file for inclusion in a system-wide nginx
configuration redirect the output of the following command into a file:

::

    $ bin/omero web config nginx

.. literalinclude:: nginx-omero.conf

.. note::
    OMERO.web requires ``body_in_file_only`` adjusted in your default nginx 
    config because nginx must buffer incoming data. Make sure you have that 
    set to the following config:

    ::

        http {
            ...
            sendfile on;
            send_timeout 60s;
            client_max_body_size 0;
            ...
        }

To configure an HTTPS server follow
`the nginx documentation <http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html>`_.

.. note::
    Make sure ``fastcgi_param HTTPS $https;`` is uncommented.


Starting OMERO.web
------------------

Start the Django FastCGI workers:

::

    $ bin/omero web start
    ... static files copied to '/usr/local/dev/openmicroscopy/dist/lib/python/omeroweb/static'.
    Starting OMERO.web... [OK]

The Django FastCGI workers are managed **separately** from other
OMERO.server processes. You can check their status or stop them using the
following commands:

::

    $ bin/omero web status
    OMERO.web status... [RUNNING] (PID 59217)
    $ bin/omero web stop
    Stopping OMERO.web... [OK]
    Django FastCGI workers (PID 59217) killed.
