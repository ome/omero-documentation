DEPRECATED: OMERO.web Apache and mod_wsgi deployment (Unix/Linux)
=================================================================

.. _apache_wsgi_configuration:

Apache 2.2+ with mod_wsgi configuration (Unix/Linux)
----------------------------------------------------

.. note:: Since OMERO 5.2, the OMERO.web framework no longer bundles
      a copy of the Django package, instead manual installation of
      the Django dependency is required. It is highly recommended to use
      `Django 1.8`_ (LTS) which requires Python 2.7. For more information
      see :ref:`python-requirements` on the
      :doc:`/sysadmins/version-requirements` page.
      
      Also note that support for Apache deployment is deprecated as of OMERO
      5.2.6 and is likely be dropped during the 5.3.x line.

OMERO.web uses the
`Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) <http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/learn.html>`_
as a primary deployment platform. The Python standard
`PEP 3333 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/>`_
that describes how a web server communicates with web applications.

.. _apache_default_configuration:

Apache default configuration (Unix/Linux)
-----------------------------------------

Install `Django 1.8`_ using package requirements file:

::

   $ pip install -r share/web/requirements-py27-apache.txt


.. note:: For more details refer to
          :djangodoc:`how to install Django 1.8 <topics/install/#install-the-django-code>`
          or :djangodoc:`hot to upgrade Django to 1.8 <topics/install/#remove-any-old-versions-of-django>`.

Additional settings can be configured by changing the following properties:

- :property:`omero.web.application_server.max_requests` to 500

- :property:`omero.web.wsgi_workers` to (2 x NUM_CORES) + 1

  .. note::
      **Do not** scale the number of workers to the number of clients
      you expect to have. OMERO.web should only need 4-12 worker
      processes to handle many requests per second.


.. _apache_mod_wsgi_configuration:

Apache configuration (Unix/Linux)
---------------------------------

If you have installed Apache, install `mod\_wsgi <http://www.modwsgi.org/>`_.

OMERO can automatically generate a
configuration file for your web server. The location of the file
will depend on your system, please refer to your web server's manual.
See :ref:`customizing_your_omero_web_installation_unix`
for additional customization options.

Set the following:

::

    $bin/omero config set omero.web.application_server "wsgi"

Creates symlinks for static media files

::

    $bin/omero web syncmedia

To create a site configuration file for inclusion in the main Apache
configuration redirect the output of the following command into a file:

For Apache 2.4, run the following command:

::

    $ bin/omero web config apache24 > httpd-omero.conf


For Apache 2.2, run the following command:

::

    $ bin/omero web config apache > httpd-omero.conf

Configuration file:

.. literalinclude:: apache-omero.conf
   :lines: 55-

To configure an HTTPS server follow
`the Apache documentation <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_ssl.html>`_.

Then reload Apache.


Running OMERO.web (Unix/Linux)
------------------------------

OMERO.web is used in 'daemon' mode where UNIX sockets are used to communicate
between the Apache child processes and the daemon processes which are
to handle a request. **OMERO.web does not provide any management for these
'daemon' processes;** ``bin/omero web start/status/stop``
**will not work as they are for managing gunicorn processes only.**
