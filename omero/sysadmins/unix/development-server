If you want the development version of OMERO.server, you can clone the source
code from the project's GitHub account to build locally:

::

    $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy
    $ cd openmicroscopy && ./build.py

.. note::
    If you have a GitHub account and you plan to develop code for OMERO, you
    should make a fork into your own account and then clone this fork to your
    local development machine, e.g.

    ::

        $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/YOURNAMEHERE/openmicroscopy
        $ cd openmicroscopy && ./build.py

Alternatively, you can download a

from our continuous integration server.
