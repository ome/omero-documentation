OMERO.server to OMERO.fs migration
==================================


The OME team puts the safety of users' data first. The shift towards the
OMERO.fs paradigm changes the way images are imported to and stored on
OMERO.server. This means that migration of an existing pre-OMERO.fs production
server to OMERO.fs has to be performed with caution.

Currently, research and testing are being performed to increase the
reliability of the migration steps. At present it is not possible to migrate
an OMERO.server from the 4.x line to the OMERO.fs version. However, it is
possible to substitute OMERO.server with an OMERO.fs-enabled version. Legacy
data will be preserved and all subsequent imports will happen using the
updated logic.
