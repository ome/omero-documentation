OMERO.server 4.x to 5.x migration
=================================


The OME team puts the safety of users' data first. The shift towards the
OMERO.fs paradigm in the 5.x line changes the way images are imported
to and stored on OMERO.server. This means that migration of an existing
4.x production server to 5.x has to be performed with caution.

Currently, research and testing are being performed to increase the
reliability of the migration steps. At present it is not possible to migrate
an OMERO.server from the 4.x line to the 5.x line. A long-term OME
approach will be to preserve legacy data when migration becomes possible.
