FS configuration options
========================

Background
----------

Users import their image files to the OMERO.fs server. The contents of
these files are kept intact by the server and effort is also made to
preserve the files' path and name, so that OMERO.fs can become a
trusted repository for the master copy of users' data. While the
default server configuration from :source:`etc/omero.properties`
should typically suffice, :omerocmd:`config set` may be used to adjust
settings related to file uploads. These settings are explained below.

Template path
-------------

When files are uploaded to the repository, a parent directory is
created to receive the upload. A multi-file image has all its files
stored in the same parent directory, though they may be in different
subdirectories of that parent to mirror the original directory
structure before upload. The :literal:`omero.fs.repo.path` setting
defines the creation of that parent directory.

There is some flexibility in how this parent directory is named. The
constraints are:

* the path components must be :literal:`/`-separated, even on Windows
  systems

* the first path component must be :literal:`%user%_%userId%`

* the path must be unique for each import; it is for this reason that
  the :literal:`%time%` term expands to a time with millisecond
  resolution

Legal file names
----------------

Although OMERO.fs attempts to preserve file naming, the server's
operating system or file system is likely to somehow constrain what
file names may be stored by OMERO.fs. This is of particular concern
when a user may upload from a more permissive system to a server on a
less permissive system, or when it is anticipated that the server
itself may be migrated to a less permissive system. The server never
accepts Unicode control characters in file names.

The :literal:`omero.fs.repo.path_rules` setting defines the combination
of restrictions that the server must apply in accepting file uploads.
The restrictions are grouped into named sets:

:literal:`Windows required`
        prohibits names with the characters :literal:`"`,
        :literal:`*`, :literal:`/`, :literal:`:`, :literal:`<`,
        :literal:`>`, :literal:`?`, :literal:`\\`, :literal:`|`,
        names beginning with :literal:`$`, the names :literal:`AUX`,
        :literal:`CLOCK$`, :literal:`CON`, :literal:`NUL`,
        :literal:`PRN`, :literal:`COM1` to :literal:`COM9`,
        :literal:`LPT1` to :literal:`LPT9`, and anything beginning
        with one of those names followed by :literal:`.`

:literal:`Windows optional`
        prohibits names ending with :literal:`.` or a space

:literal:`UNIX required`
        prohibits names with the character :literal:`/`

:literal:`UNIX optional`
        prohibits names beginning with :literal:`.` or :literal:`-`

These rules are applied to each separate path component of the file
name on the client's system. So, for instance, an upload of a file
:literal:`/tmp/myfile.tif` from a Linux system would satisfy the
:literal:`UNIX required` restrictions because neither of the path
components :literal:`tmp` and :literal:`myfile.tif` contains a
:literal:`/` character.

Applying the "optional" restrictions does not assist OMERO.fs at all;
those restrictions are designed to ease manual maintenance of the
directory specified by the :literal:`omero.managed.dir` setting, being
where the server stores users' uploaded files.

Checksum algorithm
------------------

As the client uploads each file to the server, it calculates a
checksum for the file. After the upload is complete the client reports
that checksum to the server. The server then calculates the checksum
for the corresponding file from its local filesystem and checks that
it matches what the client reported. File integrity is thus assured
because corruption during transmission or writing would be revealed by
a checksum mismatch.

There are various algorithms by which checksums may be calculated. To
calculate comparable checksums the client and server use the same
algorithm. The server API permits clients to specify the algorithm,
but it is expected that they will typically accept the server default
set with the :literal:`omero.checksum.default` setting.

The available values, specified in
:source:`components/model/resources/mappings/acquisition.ome.xml`, are
presently:

* :literal:`Adler-32`

* :literal:`CRC-32`

* :literal:`MD5-128`

* :literal:`Murmur3-32`

* :literal:`Murmur3-128`

* :literal:`SHA1-160`

The number that suffixes each of the checksum algorithm names
specifies the bit width of the resulting checksum. A larger bit width
makes it less likely that different files will have the same checksum
by coincidence, but lengthens the checksum hex strings that are
reported to the user and stored in the :literal:`hash` column of the
:literal:`originalfile` table in the database.
