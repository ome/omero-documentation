Restricted administrators OMERO.web interface to server permissions mapping
===========================================================================


Summary
-------

OMERO allows you to create administrators with a subset of the full
administrator privileges,
see :doc:`/sysadmins/admins-with-restricted-privileges`.
The OMERO.web user interface form for creation and editing of
restricted administrators
(see the :help:`create new users <sharing-data#admin>` section)
collates the server-side privileges
into fewer options and gives the options user friendly
names. Here, the mapping of the OMERO.web options to the 
server-side privileges is given. The server-side privileges
are more granular and direct work with them is possible on the CLI,
as described in :doc:`/sysadmins/cli/LightAdmins`.

.. note::
    **CLI lists restrictions, OMERO.web lists privileges**
    The lists shown using CLI commands recommended in 
    :doc:`/sysadmins/cli/LightAdmins` will be complementary
    lists to the ones which can be deduced from the table above.

.. note::
    **ReadSession privilege is never given to restricted admin**
    In OMERO.web, you can never create an administrator with restricted
    privileges who has the "ReadSession" privilege.
