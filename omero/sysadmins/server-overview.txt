Server overview
===============

The OMERO server system provides storage and processing of image data
which conforms to the :model_doc:`OME Specification <specifications/>`.
It can be run on commodity hardware to provide your own storage needs,
or run site-wide to provide a large-scale collaborative environment.

Although getting started with the server is relatively straightforward,
it does require installing several software systems, and more advanced
usage including backups and integrated logins, requires a
knowledgeable system administrator.

You may find the :doc:`/users/clients-overview` user guide useful before 
working through the installation and maintenance guides provided in this 
section of the documentation.

Developing the server
---------------------

The server system is composed of several components, each of which runs
in a separate process but is co-ordinated centrally.

-  :doc:`/developers/server-blitz` - the data server provides access to 
   metadata stored in a relational database as well as the binary image data 
   on disk.
-  :doc:`/sysadmins/dropbox` - a filesystem watcher which notifies the server
   of newly uploaded or modified files and runs a fully automatic import 
   (designed as the first implementation of :doc:`/developers/Server/FS` 
   referred to in the architecture diagram).

If you are interested in building components for the server, modifying
an existing component, or just looking for more background information, there 
is a section about the server within the :doc:`/developers/index`;
the best starting point is the :doc:`/developers/Server` for developers.
