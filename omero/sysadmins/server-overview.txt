Server overview
===============

The OMERO server system provides storage and processing of image data
which conforms to the :model_doc:`OME Specification <specifications/>`.
It can be run on commodity hardware to provide your own storage needs,
or run site-wide to provide a large-scale collaborative environment.

Administration
--------------

Although getting started with the server is relatively straightforward,
it does require installing several software systems, and more advanced
usage including backups, integrated logins, etc. requires a
knowledgeable system administrator.

After working through the :doc:`/users/clients-overview`
section, the following guides to administering your installation of
OMERO.server may be of interest:

Developer documentation
-----------------------

The server system is composed of several components, each of which runs
in a separate process but is co-ordinated centrally.

-  :doc:`/developers/server-blitz` - The data server provides access to 
   metadata stored in a relational database as well as the binary image data 
   on disk.
-  :doc:`/sysadmins/server-fs` - A filesystem watcher which notifes the server    
   of newly uploaded or modified files.
-  :ref:`dropbox` - Utilizes fs to find newly uploaded 
   files and run a fully automatic import.

..
    -  :doc:`/developers/server-processor` - Processors provide background
       execution of Python and Matlab scripts.
    -  :doc:`/developers/server-rendering` - The RenderingEngine provides
       server-side processing of raw image data for visualization on low-end
       client machines.

If you are interested in building components for the server, modifying
an existing component, or just looking for more background information,
the best starting point is the :doc:`/developers/Server` page.
