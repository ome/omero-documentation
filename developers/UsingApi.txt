Using the OMERO API
===================

OMERO API is available in Python, Java, Matlab and C++. 
The API is the same for each language, although we have developed some additional
client-side libraries to make working with the API easier. E.g. Python 'Blitz Gateway'.

This section provides numerous code samples in the various languages to get you started.
More details on client-side coding and the OMERO API can be found elsewhere.
