OMERO.clients
=============

The OMERO model is implemented as a relational PostgreSQL database on
the OMERO server and mapped to code-generated model objects used by the
clients in the various supported languages (see :doc:`/developers/index`). The 
OMERO API consists of a number of services for working with these objects and
associated binary data. Typically, clients will use various stateless
services to query the OMERO model and then use the stateful services for
exchange of binary data or image rendering.

A typical client interaction might have an outline such as:

-  Log in to OMERO, obtaining connection and 'service factory'
-  Use the stateless 'Query Service' or 'Container Service' to traverse
   Projects, Datasets and Images
-  Use the stateful 'Rendering Engine' or 'Thumbnail Service' to view
   images.
-  Use the stateful 'Raw Pixels Service' or 'Raw File Store' to retrieve
   pixel or file data for analysis
-  Create new Annotations or other objects and save them with the
   stateless 'Update Service'
-  Close stateful services to free resources and close the connection

OMERO.clients use a common 'gateway' to communicate with an OMERO.server
installation and allow the user to import, display, edit, and manage
server data. The OMERO team has developed a suite of clients, but the
open source nature of the OMERO project also allows developers to create
their own, customized clients.

-  **End users and scientists** interested in using our OMERO client
   software should see the :doc:`/users/clients-overview`

-  **Developers** interested in writing custom OMERO clients should See
   |DevelopingOmeroClients|.

Examples for all the :doc:`/developers/server-blitz` languages
(|OmeroPy|, |OmeroJava|, |OmeroCpp|, and |OmeroMatlab|) are provided under:

-  :sourcedir:`examples`

The examples under the ``OmeroClients`` directory are more thoroughly
discussed on the |OmeroClients| page. This is
a good starting point for anyone interested in working with the
|OmeroApi| or the |OmeroModel|.

Examples with Java source code are available under:
