OMERO.clients
=============

OMERO.clients use a common 'gateway' to communicate with an OMERO.server
installation and allow the user to import, display, edit, and manage
server data. The OMERO team has developed a suite of clients, but the
open source nature of the OMERO project also allows developers to create
their own, customized clients.

-  **End users and scientists** interested in using our OMERO client
   software should see the client documentation page located at `Â the
   main OME
   website <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/getting-started/client-documentation>`_.

-  **Developers** interested in writing custom OMERO clients should See
   |DevelopingOmeroClients|.

Examples for all the :ref:`server/blitz` languages
(|OmeroPy|, |OmeroJava|, |OmeroCpp|, and |OmeroMatlab|) are provided under:

-  :source:`examples`

The examples under the ``OmeroClients`` directory are more thoroughly
discussed on the |OmeroClients| page. This is
a good starting point for anyone interested in working with the
|OmeroApi| or the |OmeroModel|.

Examples with Java source code are available under:
:source:`Examples <components/insight/TEST/org/openmicroscopy/shoola/examples>`
