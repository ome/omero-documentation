OMERO is Beta
=============

What do we mean by Beta?
------------------------

We have been releasing the **OMERO** software platform since Jan 2007
(see full ` roadmap <https://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/roadmap>`_
to see the history of releases). We decided to call these **OMERO**
releases "Beta" as we are approaching a "full" solution for image
management, visualization, and analysis in steps, or what we usually
refer to as
` milestones <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/roadmap>`_. Thus,
when we say "**OMERO is Beta**\ ", we mean that it does not yet fully
address the image informatics challenge of biological microscopy and
high content screens (HCS). However, OMERO is used in many production
facilities, commercial products (e.g., PerkinElmer's
` Columbus® <http://www.cellularimaging.com/products/Columbus/>`_ and
Applied Precision's ` DMS <http://www.api.com/deltavision.asp>`_) and
runs public on-line image repositories (e.g., the ` JCB
DataViewer <http://jcb-dataviewer.rupress.org>`_ and the ` ASCB CELL®
Library <http://celllibrary.org>`_).

Our current goals for OMERO are
`available <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/future-development>`_.
We very much appreciate any `comments or
feedback <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/community>`_ on our
priorities.

Can I use OMERO for my data?
----------------------------

This is tricky-- the best answer we can give is "we do!". We are running
production servers, using **OMERO** for our own data, totalling just
over 7 TB of image data and we know of many other sites using OMERO to
manage their scientific data. Rough statistics for one of our production
servers, housing our own data, as of Feb 2011:

-  ~7.2 TB of images
-  ~93,000 5D images
-  ~14.1 million image frames
-  ~50 users

**OMERO** is open source and actively developed, but our Milestone
Releases are heavily tested on our own production servers before
release. Thus to the best of our knowledge, released **OMERO** packages
can be used to manage your data, but we make NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE
regarding the OMERO platform and can take no responsibility for its
performance or behavior. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS TYPE OF DISCLAIMER IS
STANDARD IN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, and is not at all related to **OMERO**
's "Beta" status.

Can you tell me when **OMERO** will come out of Beta?
-----------------------------------------------------

We've discussed this for a long time. The answer is linked to when we
see OMERO running a complete image access, visualisation, annotation,
and analysis solution.

What if I want a supported installation of **OMERO**?
