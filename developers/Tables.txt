OMERO.tables
============

The OMERO.tables API unifies the storage of columnar data from various sources,
such as automated analysis results or script-based processing, and makes them
available within OMERO.

Large and small volumes of tabular data can be stored via named columns, and
retrieved in bulk or via paging. A limited query language provides basic
filtering and selecting.

For installation instructions, see :doc:`/sysadmins/server-tables`


The interface
-------------

The :source:`slice definition file <components/blitz/resources/omero/Tables.ice>`
for the OMERO.tables API primarily defines two service interfaces and a type
hierarchy.

.. glossary::

    :class:`omero.grid.Table`
        The central service for dealing with tabular data, described
        :ref:`below <tables-omero-grid-Table>`.

.. class:: omero.grid.Tables

        An internal service used for managing table services, and can be
        ignored for almost all purposes.

.. class:: omero.grid.Column

    The base class for column types which permit returning arrays of
    columnar values (Ice_ doesn't provide an :class:`Any` type, so it is
    necessary to group values of the same type). All columns in a table
    must have the same number of rows.


Single value columns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These columns store a single value in each row.

.. class:: omero.grid.FileColumn(name, description, [values])
           omero.grid.ImageColumn(name, description, [values])
           omero.grid.RoiColumn(name, description, [values])
           omero.grid.WellColumn(name, description, [values])
           omero.grid.PlateColumn(name, description, [values])

    Id-based (`long`) columns which reference :class:`omero.model.File`,
    :class:`~Image`, :class:`~Roi`, :class:`~Well` and :class:`~Plate`
    instances respectively.

.. class:: omero.grid.BoolColumn(name, description, [values])

    A value column with `bool` (non-null) values.

.. class:: omero.grid.LongColumn(name, description, [values])

    A value column with `long` (non-null, 64-bit) values.

.. class:: omero.grid.DoubleColumn(name, description, [values])

    A value column with `double` (non-null, 64-bit) values.

    :param string name: The name of the column, each column in a table must
        have a unique name.

    :param string description: The column description, may be empty.

    :param [] values: A list of values (one value per row) used to initialise a
        column (optional).

    .. attribute:: values

        A class member holding the list of values stored in the column.


.. class:: omero.grid.StringColumn(name, description, size, [ values])

    A value column which holds strings

    :param string name: The column name.

    :param string description: The column description.

    :param long size: The maximum string length that can be stored in this
        column, `>= 1`

    :param string[] values: A list of strings (optional).


Array value columns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These columns store an array in each row.

.. class:: omero.grid.DoubleArrayColumn(name, description, size, [values])

    A value column with fixed width arrays of `double` values.

.. class:: omero.grid.LongArrayColumn(name, description, size, [values])

    A value column with fixed width arrays of `long` values.

    :param string name: The column name.

    :param string description: The column description.

    :param long size: The width of the array, `>= 1`

    :param long[][] values: A list of arrays, each of length :attr:`size`
        (optional).


.. warning::
    The OMERO.tables service currently does limited validation of string
    and array lengths. When adding or modifying data it is essential that the
    :attr:`size` parameter of a column matches that of the underlying table.

.. warning::
    Array value columns should be considered experimental for now.




Main methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: omero.grid.Data

    Holds the data retrieved from a table, also used to update a table.

    .. attribute:: lastModification

        The timestamp of the last update to the table.

    .. attribute:: rowNumbers

        The row indicies of the values retrieved from the table.

    .. attribute:: columns

        A list of columns


.. _tables-omero-grid-Table:

.. class:: omero.grid.Table

    The main interface to the Tables service.

    .. method:: getHeaders()

        :return: An empty list of columns describing the table. Fill in the
            :attr:`values` of these columns to add a new row to the table.

    .. method:: getNumberOfRows()

        :return: The number of rows in the table.

    .. method:: readCoordinates(rowNumbers)

        Read a set of entire rows in the table.

        :param long[] rowNumbers: A list of row indicies to be retrieved from
            the table.
        :return: The requested rows as a :class:`~omero.grid.Data` object.

    .. method:: read(colNumbers, start, stop)

        Read a subset of columns and rows from a table.

        :param long[] colNumber: A list of column indicies to be retrieved
            from the table.
        :param long start: The index of the first row to retrieve.
        :param long stop: The index of the `last+1` row to retrieve (uses
            similar semantics to :func:`range`).
        :return: The requested columns and rows as a
            :class:`~omero.grid.Data` object.

        .. note:: `start=0, stop=0` currently returns the first row instead
            of empty as would be expected using the normal Python range
            semantics. This may change in future.

    .. method:: getWhereList(condition, variables, start, stop, step)

        Run a query on a table, see :ref:`tables-query-language`.

        :param string condition: The query string
        :param variables: A mapping of strings and variable values to be
            substituted into `condition`. This can often be left empty.
        :param long start: The index of the `first` row to consider.
        :param long stop: The index of the `last+1` row to consider.
        :param long step: The stepping interval between the `start` and `stop`
            rows to consider, using the same semantics as :func:`range`. Set
            to `0` to disable stepping.
        :return: A list of row indices matching the condition which can be
            passed as the first parameter of :meth:`readCoordinates` or
            :meth:`read`.

        .. note:: `variables` seems to add unnecessary complexity, should it
            be removed?

    .. method:: initialize(columns)

        Initialize a new table. Any column values are ignored, use
        :meth:`addData` to add these values.

        :param Column[] columns: A list of columns whose names and types are
            used to setup the table.

    .. method:: addData(columns)

        Append one or more full rows to the table.

        :param Column[] columns: A list of columns, such as those returned by
            :meth:`getHeaders()`, whose values are the rows to be added to the
            table.

    .. method:: update(data)

        Modify one or more columns and/or rows in a table.

        :param Data data: A :class:`~omero.grid.Data` object previously
            obtained using :meth:`read` or :meth:`readCoordinates` with column
            values to be updated.


You many find the :ref:`Python <python_omero_tables_code_samples>` and
:ref:`Java <java_omero_tables_code_samples>` annotated code samples helpful,
in addition to the :ref:`examples <tables-examples>` and
:jenkins:`documentation on the API
<job/OMERO/javadoc/slice2html/omero/grid/Table.html#Table>`.
These are only an introduction to using OMERO.tables and do not show its full
potential, see :ref:`tables-going-forward` for some inspiration.


.. _tables-examples:

Examples
--------

-  Hello World:
   :source:`examples/OmeroTables/first.py <examples/OmeroTables/first.py>`
-  Creating a Measurement Table:
   :source:`examples/OmeroTables/MeasurementTable.java <examples/OmeroTables/MeasurementTable.java>`
-  Querying a Table:
   :source:`examples/OmeroTables/FindMeasurements.java <examples/OmeroTables/FindMeasurements.java>`


The implementation
------------------

Currently, each table is backed by a single HDF table. Since PyTables
(and HDF in the general case) don't support concurrent access, OMERO.tables 
provides a global locking mechanism which permits multiple views of the same 
data. Each `OMERO.tables` file (registered as an ``OriginalFile`` in the
database), is composed of a single HDF table with any number of certain 
limited column types.


.. _tables-query-language:

Query language
--------------

The query language mentioned above is *currently* the PyTables
`condition syntax <http://pytables.github.com/usersguide/condition_syntax.html>`_.
Columns are referenced by name. The following operators are supported:

-  Logical operators: ``&, |, ~``
-  Comparison operators: ``<, <=, ==, !=, >=, >``
-  Unary arithmetic operators: ``-``
-  Binary arithmetic operators: ``+, -, *, /, **, %``

and the following functions:

-  ``where(bool, number1, number2)``: number — number1 if the bool
   condition is true, number2 otherwise.
-  ``{sin,cos,tan}(float|complex)``: float\|complex — trigonometric
   sine, cosine or tangent.
-  ``{arcsin,arccos,arctan}(float|complex)``: float\|complex —
   trigonometric inverse sine, cosine or tangent.
-  ``arctan2(float1, float2)``: float — trigonometric inverse tangent of
   float1/float2.
-  ``{sinh,cosh,tanh}(float|complex)``: float\|complex — hyperbolic
   sine, cosine or tangent.
-  ``{arcsinh,arccosh,arctanh}(float|complex)``: float\|complex —
   hyperbolic inverse sine, cosine or tangent.
-  ``{log,log10,log1p}(float|complex)``: float\|complex — natural,
   base-10 and log(1+x) logarithms.
-  ``{exp,expm1}(float|complex)``: float\|complex — exponential and
   exponential minus one.
-  ``sqrt(float|complex)``: float\|complex — square root.
-  ``{real,imag}(complex)``: float — real or imaginary part of complex.
-  ``complex(float, float)``: complex — complex from real and imaginary
   parts.

for example, if `id` is the name of a :class:`~omero.grid.LongColumn`

::

    table.getWhereList(condition='(id>x)', variables={'x':omero.rtypes.rint(5)},
        start=2, stop=10, step=3)

will extract a subset of rows (2, 5, 8) as indicated by `start`, `stop` and
`step`, substitute `5` in place of `x` in the `condition`, and evaluate
`condition` so as to return the indices of rows where column `id` is greater
than `5`.



.. _tables-going-forward:

Going forward
-------------

The Tables API itself provides little more than a remotely accessible
store, think of it as a server for Excel-like spreadsheets. We are
currently looking into the facilities that can be built on top of it,
and are **very** open to suggestions. For example, the
:jenkins:`IRoi interface <job/OMERO/javadoc/slice2html/omero/api/IRoi.html#IRoi>`
has been extended to filter ROIs by a given
measurement. This allows seeing only those results from a particular
analysis run. The following example shows how to set up such a
measurement and retrieve its results:

:source:`iroi.py <examples/OmeroTables/iroi.py>`

For an example of production code that parses out such measurements,
see :source:`populate_roi.py <components/tools/OmeroPy/src/omero/util/populate_roi.py>`.

The `IRoi` interface has been integrated into OMERO.insight, allowing for
the visualization and export of OMERO.tables:

.. figure:: /images/MeasurementListSep09.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Choice between multiple measurements

    Choice between multiple measurements

We are also looking into a NoSQL-style storage mechanism for OMERO, either as
an alternative back-end to OMERO.tables or as an additional key-value type
store. Any suggestions or ideas would be
:doc:`very welcome </users/community-resources>`.
