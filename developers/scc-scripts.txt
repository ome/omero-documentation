Continous integration scripts
=============================

https://github.com/openmicroscopy/snoopycrimecop hosts a series of utility
scripts used in the continuous integration.

If you find a bug or if you want an additional feature to be implemented,
please `open an issue <https://github.com/openmicroscopy/snoopycrimecop/issues>`_.

Installation
------------

The scc tools are a set  of Python_ based utility programs. The main 
requirement is the **PyGithub** package ::

	$ pip install PyGithub
	$ pip freeze | grep PyGithub
	PyGithub==1.9.1

If using Python 2.6 and earlier, you will also need the **argparse** package
(included by default in Python 2.7 and above)::

	$ pip install argparse
	$ pip freeze | grep argparse
	argparse==1.2.1

The tools suite can then be installed using Homebrew::

    $ brew update && brew install scc
    $ scc -h

Github connection
-----------------

Most of the scc commands instantiate a Github connection using the PyGithub
package. Unless the :option:`--token` option is passed to the scc command, the
command first looks for the `github.token` specified in the git config file
and, if found, uses this token to connect to Github::

	$ ./scc.py merge master --info -v
	2013-01-16 22:03:49,633 [  scc.config] DEBUG Found github.token
	...

If no token is found, the command looks for a `github.user` in the git config
file and, if found, uses this username to connect to Github::

	$ ./scc.py merge master --info -v
	2013-01-16 22:06:00,256 [  scc.config] DEBUG Found github.user
	Enter password for http://github.com/sbesson:

.. note::
   The password to be entered here is the Github password.

Finally, if no token or user is found, both the Github username and password
are queried at the prompt::

	$ ./scc.py merge master --info -v
	# github.token and github.user not found.
	# See `./scc.py token` for simpifying use.
	Username or token: sbesson
	Enter password for http://github.com/sbesson:

.. _scc merge:

scc merge
---------

.. program:: scc merge

Merge all the open PRs based on specified branch, including all submodules.

The first argument is the name of the base branch of origin, e.g.::

	$ scc merge develop

.. option:: --comment

	Add a comment to the PR if there is a conflict while merging the PR
	::

		$ scc merge develop --comment

.. option:: --default <type>, -D <type>

	Specify the default set of PRs to be included in the merge

	Four options are currently implemented: `none`, `mine`, `org` and `all`.
	By default (`org`), only PRs opened by public members of the repository
	organization are included so the following are equivalent::

		$ scc merge develop
		$ scc merge develop --default org
		$ scc merge develop -D org

.. option:: --exclude <filters>, -E <filters>

	Exclude PR by label, user or number

	Label filters can be specified using `label:my_label`, user filters using
	`user:username` and PR filters using `pr:xx`, e.g.::

		$ scc merge develop -E label:exclude_label -E user:my_user -E pr:45

	If no key is specified, it is assumed the filter is a label filter.

	By default, only PRs labelled as `exclude` are excluded so the following
	are  equivalent::

		$ scc merge develop
		$ scc merge develop -E label:exclude
		$ scc merge develop -E exclude

.. option:: --include <filters>, -I <filters>

	Include PR by label, user or number

	Label filters can be specified using `label:my_label`, user filters using
	`user:username` and PR filters using `pr:xx`, e.g.::

		$ scc merge develop -I label:include_label -I user:my_user -I pr:40

	If no key is specified, it is assumed the filter is a label filter.

	By default, only PRs labelled as `include` are included so the following
	are  equivalent::

		$ scc merge develop
		$ scc merge develop -I label:include
		$ scc merge develop -I include

.. option:: --info

	Display the candidate PRs to merge but do not merge them
	::

	$ scc merge develop --info

.. option:: --push <branchname>

	Push the locally merged branch to Github
	::

		$ scc merge develop --push my-merged-branch

.. option:: --reset

	Recursively reset each repository to the HEAD of the base branch
	::

		$ scc merge develop --reset

As a concrete example, the first step of the :term:`OMERO-merge-develop` job
is calling the following merge command:

::

	$ scc merge develop --no-ask --reset --comment --push merge/develop/latest

scc rebase
----------
.. program:: scc rebase

Rebase a PR (open or closed) onto another branch and open a new PR.

The first argument is the number of the PR to rebase and the second argument
is the name of the branch onto which the PR should be rebased::

	$ scc rebase 142 develop

Assuming the head branch used to open the PR 142 was called `branch_142`, this
command will rebase the tip of `branch_142` onto origin/develop, create a new
local branch called `rebased/develop/branch_142`, push this branch to Github
and open a new PR. Finally, the command will switch back to the original
branch prior to rebasing and delete the local `rebased/develop/branch_142`.

.. note::

	By default, :program:`scc rebase` uses the branches of the `origin` remote
	to rebase the PR. To specify another remote, use the
	:option:`--remote` option.

.. option:: --no-pr

	Skip the opening of the PR
	::

		$ scc rebase 142 develop --no-pr

.. option:: --no-delete

	Do not delete the local rebased branch

	::

		$ scc rebase 142 develop --no-delete

.. option:: --remote

	Specify the name of the remote to use for the rebase

	::

		$ scc rebase 142 develop --remote snoopycrimecop

If :program:`scc rebase` fails (e.g. due to conflict during the rebase), you
may end up in a detached HEAD state. In this case, you will need to manually
switch to your previous branch::

	git checkout old_branch

scc version
-----------
.. program:: scc version

Return the version of the scc tools::

	$ scc version
	0.2.1

.. versionadded:: 0.2.0

.. _scc deploy:

Documentation deployment
------------------------

https://github.com/openmicroscopy/snoopycrimecop hosts two scripts:
doc_init.sh and doc_deploy.sh. The goal of the scripts is to enable
overwriting of deployed doc content and allow for “hot-swapping” content
served by Apache without downtime and HTTP 404s.

The logic behind the scripts follows the method outlined in
https://gist.github.com/datagrok/3807742#file_symlink_replacement.md. The
hudson jobs :term:`BIOFORMATS-docs-merge-stable`,
:term:`BIOFORMATS-docs-merge-develop`, :term:`OMERO-docs-merge-stable`,
:term:`OMERO-docs-merge-develop` and OMERO-docs-internal deploy the
documentation artifacts to necromancer. The target directory (sphinx-docs) is
controlled by the hudson:hudson user, so all file system operations are
allowed. Each job has the target directory configured in the SSH publisher
target directory property. After deployment has happened to a temporary
directory, a series of symlink moves happens making sure that the symlink
points to the updated content.
