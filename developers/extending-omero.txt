Extending OMERO
===============

Developers documentation is available on :doc:`here </developers/index>`. 
There are extension points to add OMERO server functionality as described on 
the :doc:`/developers/Server/ExtendingOmero` page as well as add to agents to 
OMERO.insight. See :doc:`/developers/Insight/Architecture` for more 
information.

Instructions on writing your own :doc:`/developers/GettingStarted` or 
scripts that work via the :doc:`/developers/Modules/Api`, in a number of 
languages are listed as part of the :doc:`analysis </sysadmins/server-analysis>` page.
