OMERO Type Language
===================

The |OmeroModel| has two general parts:
first, the long studied and well-established core model and second, the
user-specified portion. It is vital that there is a central definition
of both parts of the object model. To allow users to easily define new
types we need a simple domain specific language (or little language)
which can be mapped to Hibernate mapping files. See an example at:

-  :source:`components/model/resources/mappings/acquisition.ome.xml`

From this DSL, various artifacts can be generated: XML Schema, Java
classes, SQL for generating tables, etc. The ultimate goal is to have no
exceptions in the model.
