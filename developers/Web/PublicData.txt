Public Data in OMERO.web
========================

Since OMERO 4.4, the OMERO.web framework has supported auto-login for a single 
username / password. This means that any "public" visitors to certain 
OMERO.web pages will be automatically logged in and will be able to access and 
data that is available to the defined 'public user'.

Here's how to go about setting this up on your OMERO.web install:

-   Create a group with readonly permissions (name can be anything, E.g.
    "public-data". We use read-only permissions so that the public user will 
    not be able to modify, delete or annotate data belonging to other members.

-   Create a member of this group, noting the username and password (we'll 
    enter these below). Again, the First Name, Last Name, username & password 
    can be anything you like.

-   Enable the public user and set their username and password:

    ::

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.enabled True

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.user '<username>'

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.password '<password>'

-   Set a URL filter for which the OMERO.web public user is allowed to 
    navigate.
    Default: /(?!webadmin) (Python reqular expression). You probably don't 
    want the whole webclient UI to be publicly visible (although you could do 
    this).

    The idea is that you can create the public pages yourself (see OMERO.web 
    developers page since we don't provide public pages. E.g. to only allow 
    urls that start with '/my_web_public' you'd use: 

    ::

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.url_filter '^/my_web_public'

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.url_filter'^/(my_web_public|webgateway)'   # OR webgateway

    If you simply want to enable the webgateway image viewer, thumbnails etc

    ::

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.url_filter '^/my_web_public'

    Exotic matching techniques can be used but more explicit regular 
    expressions are needed when attempting to filter based on a base URL:

    'webtest' matches '/webtest' but also '/webclient/webtest' 'dataset' 
    matches  '/webtest/dataset' and also '/webclient/dataset' '/webtest' 
    matches '/webtest...' but also '/webclient/webtest' '/webtest' matches 
    '/webtest...' but not '/webclient/webtest'

Server to authenticate against. Default: 1 (the first server in 
omero.web.server_list)

::

    $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.server_id 2
