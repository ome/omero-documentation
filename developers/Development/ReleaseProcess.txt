Release Process
===============

This page describes the actions points and step to follow before major
releases. There are various time-dependencies, so read the whole page
before beginning any work. It may be sensible to create tickets for some
if not many of the following points.

Pull Request (PR) Review
------------------------

See :doc:`/developers/Development/UsingGit`, for more
information about our usage of git and github. Before merging code to
develop, each PR is reviewed. Follow a list of "best practices" in order
to speed up the review.

-  Persons who work on the code

   -  Add to the ticket or to the PR what must be tested e.g. click
      view, check that the viewer opens.

   -  If a Bio-Formats change, add to the PR the command that can be
      used to test the reader, the images to use and where to find them
      (if necessary), etc. (``-Dtestng.directory=$DATA ...``)

   -  If UI changes, add to the ticket a screenshot before implementing
      the feature and one after. For new feature a movie can be more
      suitable.

-  PR opening.

   -  Add a comment

      -  with a list of tickets to be tested, use hyperlink.
      -  the potential tester(s) e.g. ``@qidane, @jburel``
      -  The merge-blue build to use

-  PR review

   -  indicate the merge-blue build number (several builds might have
      happened since)
   -  list the tickets that worked, use hyperlink
   -  list the tickets that did not work, use hyperlink. If necessary
      add more feedback to the ticket or the PR.

Model
-----

-  Beginning of milestone: Create a log ticket to record every ticket
   number corresponding to a model change.
-  Prepare upgrade stylesheet before freeze.
-  Freeze model **at least 3 weeks** before DB Upgrade freeze. To allow
   the propagation of those changes through the stack i.e. B-F, DB,
   tests, etc.
-  Prepare downgrade stylesheet.

DB Upgrade
----------

-  List of proposed changes to DB should be submitted **at the latest 3
   weeks** before code freeze. To allow enough time to adjust DB.
-  Preliminary testing phase.

Feature Freeze (bug fixing only)
--------------------------------

-  Freeze **at least 4 weeks** before the scheduled release date.
-  Code freeze should correspond if possible to the end of sprint or to
   the middle of sprint (usually Thursday)
-  All changes in API incompatibilities and changes to public strings
   (re: i18n) should be finalized.

Testing
-------

-  Review tests

   -  Jenkins Linux & Windows "start" jobs **should be passing**
   -  See: :jenkins:`job/OMERO-trunk-components>`.

-  :wiki:`BioFormats <BioFormats>`.

   -  During development phase, keep track of files failing to import
      submitted to the team.
   -  Confirmation all the appropriate images are in squig in test
      images good.
   -  The evolution of test image good, this requires reviewing the
      submitted images from qa that had previously failed but are now
      successfully importing.
   -  The creation of the testing user story and file format tickets all
      assigned with the correct details before testing starts.
   -  Email sent out with full list of images to test for that release.

      -  The confirmation and validation of any specific file formats
         that require additional tests for specific fixes in the
         release.

-  Scenarios

   -  Small scale scenarios reviewed by the team once a month outside of
      the testing process.
   -  The scenarios will be reviewed 2 weeks before the code freeze
      checking the enhancements and new features.
   -  `Testing Scenarios </ome/wiki/TestingScenarios>`_ should be
      up-to-date when code freeze.
   -  Stories (scenario and file formats) and tasks created. One Task
      per scenario.
   -  Stories (scenario and file formats) to collect bugs created.
   -  Time window to go through the testing tasks (scenario and file
      formats): **2 working days**, e.g. if testing starts on Monday,
      all the testing tasks should be completed by the end of Tuesday.
   -  Update testing server, only one person in charge
   -  update server every morning. (**Suggestion**: Unix & Windows!)
   -  notify team by e-mail indicating builds to use (clients, server,
      B-F) server address etc.

-  Recording BUG:

   -  Ticket summary must start with the work BUG:
   -  Add ticket to the story corresponding to the testing phase.
   -  Add ticket to the current milestone
   -  Add ticket to the correct component e.g. insight, web etc.

-  Review daily tickets w/o time or owner.
-  Set time to test section w/o integration tests e.g. matlab support,
   CellProfiler
-  Include testing of upgrades from previous versions.
-  Review/Update known limitations through testing
-  Jenkins **MUST** report all logs at ``ERROR`` level as failures.

Bio-Formats Freeze (no jar changes)
-----------------------------------

-  Freeze Bio-Formats **at least 1 week** before the actual release

Release
-------

-  **No pre-meeting releases**; Need at least X week(s) before a major
   event.
-  Update version numbers for release (There should only be a **single**
   commit with this version number)

   -  Tag the SHA1 of that single commit for release:
      ``git tag -u "Josh Moore (Glencoe Software, Inc.) <josh@glencoesoftware.com>" -m "Release version 4.4.0" v.4.4.0``
   -  Push the tag to the official repository:
      ``git push origin v.4.4.0``
   -  Checkout master: ``git checkout master``
   -  Merge the newly created tag: ``git merge v.4.4.0``
   -  Push to the official repository: ``git push origin master``
   -  Update version number for the
      `UpgradeCheck </ome/wiki/UpgradeCheck>`_. This is currently done

      info also under `UpgradeCheck </ome/wiki/UpgradeCheck>`_:

      -  ``select * from registry_version;``
      -  ``update registry_version set version = '4.4.0';``

-  Create builds with jenkins

   -  ``git push origin v.4.4.0 develop`` assuming the commit isn’t

-  Announce on mailing lists and in news

Branching
---------

-  Rename "\*-trunk" jenkins jobs to "\*-<RELEASE\_NAME>"

-  Update any deployed servers (ask Josh)
-  Update online validator (See :ticket:`8640` for an example)

Demo server
-----------

-  Contact KIT if they are willing to do upgrade.
-  Notify demo users when upgrade will take place.
-  Submit any necessary configuration options while upgrading.
-  Test demo server.
-  Email announcement.
