Release process
===============

This page describes the actions points and step to follow before major
releases. There are various time-dependencies, so read the whole page
before beginning any work. It may be sensible to create tickets for some
if not many of the following points.

Pull Request (PR) review
------------------------

See :doc:`/developers/Development/UsingGit`, for more
information about our usage of git and github. Before merging code to
develop, each PR is reviewed. Follow a list of "best practices" in order
to speed up the review.

-  Persons who work on the code

   -  Add to the ticket or to the PR what must be tested e.g. click
      view, check that the viewer opens.

   -  If a Bio-Formats change, add to the PR the command that can be
      used to test the reader, the images to use and where to find them
      (if necessary), etc. (``-Dtestng.directory=$DATA ...``)

   -  If UI changes, add to the ticket a screenshot before implementing
      the feature and one after. For new feature a movie can be more
      suitable.

-  PR opening.

   -  Add a comment

      -  with a list of tickets to be tested, use hyperlink.
      -  the potential tester(s) e.g. ``@qidane, @jburel``

-  PR review

   -  list the tickets that worked, use hyperlink
   -  list the tickets that did not work, use hyperlink. If necessary
      add more feedback to the ticket or the PR.

Model
-----

-  Beginning of milestone: Create a log ticket to record every ticket
   number corresponding to a model change.
-  Prepare upgrade stylesheet before freeze.
-  Freeze model **at least 3 weeks** before database Upgrade freeze. To allow
   the propagation of those changes through the stack i.e. Bioformats, database,
   tests, etc.
-  Prepare downgrade stylesheet.

Database upgrade
----------------

-  List of proposed changes to the database should be submitted **at the latest 3
   weeks** before code freeze. To allow enough time to adjust the database.
-  Preliminary testing phase.

Feature freeze (bug fixing only)
--------------------------------

-  Freeze **at least 4 weeks** before the scheduled release date.
-  Code freeze should correspond if possible to the end of sprint or to
   the middle of sprint (usually Thursday)
-  All changes in API incompatibilities and changes to public strings
   (re: i18n) should be finalized.

Testing
-------

-  Review tests

   -  Jenkins Linux & Windows "start" jobs **should be passing**
   -  See: :jenkins:`job/OMERO-trunk-components`.

-  BioFormats

   -  During development phase, keep track of files failing to import
      submitted to the team.
   -  Confirmation all the appropriate images are in squig in test
      images good.
   -  The evolution of `test_image_good`, this requires reviewing the
      submitted images from qa that had previously failed but are now
      successfully importing.
   -  The creation of the testing user story and file format tickets all
      assigned with the correct details before testing starts.
   -  Email sent out with full list of images to test for that release.

      -  The confirmation and validation of any specific file formats
         that require additional tests for specific fixes in the
         release.

-  Recording BUG:

   -  Ticket summary must start with the work BUG:
   -  Add ticket to the story corresponding to the testing phase.
   -  Add ticket to the current milestone
   -  Add ticket to the correct component e.g. OMERO.insight, OMERO.web etc.

-  Review daily tickets w/o time or owner.
-  Include testing of upgrades from previous versions.
-  Review/Update known limitations through testing
-  Jenkins **MUST** report all logs at ``ERROR`` level as failures.

Bio-Formats freeze (no jar changes)
-----------------------------------

-  Freeze Bio-Formats **at least 1 week** before the actual release

Documentation
-------------

.. _Main Page: `Open Microscopy Environment`_

-  Website

   -  Copy snapshot of documentation under products **before** any new documentation is added.
   -  If necessary, begin editing that private location. (Note this
      requires more work). Apply all changes here in preparation for
      release. Key Pages to review:

      -  `Main Page`_ (no copy. Update on Release)
      -  Products

         -  :feature_plone:`Feature List Page <>`
         -  :omero_plone:`Big Images Support <big-images-support>`
         -  :omero_plone:`Import in OMERO.insight <import-in-omero.insight>`
         -  :omero_plone:`About Omero <omero-platform-v4>`
         -  :omero_plone:`Volume Viewer in OMERO.web <volume-viewer-in-omero.web>`
         -  :omero_plone:`Downloads <downloads>`
         -  :omero_plone:`Screenshots page <screenshots>`

      -  :about_plone:`Contributors <contributers>`
      -  Road map page:

         -  :about_plone:`Roadmap <roadmap>`
         -  :about_plone:`Version
            history <project-history/omero-version-history>`

      -  Movies page ?
      -  :about_plone:`What OMERO <what-omero>`
      -  Upgrade page

         -  i.e. add section to :doc:`/sysadmins/server-upgrade`
            including database upgrades, etc.

-  Videos. Indicate the following at the beginning of the movie:

   -  Your name
   -  version of the software
   -  subject of the movie.
   -  If your video uses the terminal, format your terminal
      to use Monaco 22pt, yes THAT BIG, pick colours with a good
      contrast and turn off window transparency!
   -  For video formatting instructions see :doc:`VideoFormatForOmeMovies`

-  Documentation of all API/model changes
-  All sphinx documentation

Release candidates
------------------

-  Give new clients to internal/external testers XX weeks before release
-  Set up a testing server for internal/external testers.
-  Upgrade local production server XX weeks before release.
-  Test all components from official zips (ImageJ, etc.)
-  Check that all clients properly detect compatible server versions

Schema pre-release checklist
----------------------------

-  XsdFu code generation
-  Upgrade online validator
-  Update fetch\_content\_from\_git.sh
-  Change develop URLs to master (FIXME)

Release
-------
.. |releasetag| replace:: v.\ |release|

-  **No pre-meeting releases**; Need at least X week(s) before a major
   event.
-  Update version numbers for release (There should only be a **single**
   commit with this version number)

   -  Tag the SHA1 of that single commit for release:

      .. parsed-literal::

         git tag -u "Josh Moore (Glencoe Software, Inc.) <josh@glencoesoftware.com>" -m "Release version \ |release|" |releasetag|

   -  Push the tag to the official repository:

      .. parsed-literal::

         git push origin |releasetag|

   -  Checkout master:

      ::

         git checkout master

   -  Merge the newly created tag:

      .. parsed-literal::

          $ git merge |releasetag|

   -  Push to the official repository:

      ::

         git push origin master

   -  Update version number for the :doc:
      `UpgradeCheck </sysadmins/UpgradeCheck>`. This is currently done
      by connecting to the “feedback” database on necromancer. Following
      info also under :doc:`/sysadmins/UpgradeCheck`:

      .. parsed-literal::
         select * from registry_version;
         update registry_version set version = '\ |release|';

-  Create builds with jenkins

   -  Assuming the commit isn’t present.

      .. parsed-literal::
         git push origin |releasetag| develop

   -  If commit is present, just click on “Build” on Jenkins
   -  Mark build as “QA”\, eventually as “Release”
   -  Copy builds to /snapshots (currently manual)
   -  This kicks off the |VM| build (automatically published to
      /snapshots)
   -  Rename the "latest-build" |VM|.

-  Publish website

   -  Archive Main Website Documentation for previous release (i.e. Move
      old documentation to versioned URL)
   -  Move “copy\_of\_” documentation to be active

-  Announce on mailing lists and in news

Branching
---------

-  Rename "\*-trunk" jenkins jobs to "\*-<RELEASE\_NAME>"
-  Add bioformats branches to /hudson/bioformats.git/git-fetch.sh and
   hooks/post-receive

Post release
------------

-  Change reports in left-bar of trac
-  Update any deployed servers (ask Josh)
-  Update online validator (See :ticket:`8640` for an example)

Demo server
-----------

-  Contact KIT if they are willing to do upgrade.
-  Notify demo users when upgrade will take place.
-  Submit any necessary configuration options while upgrading.
-  Test demo server.
-  Email announcement.
