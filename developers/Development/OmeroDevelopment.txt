Developing with OMERO
=====================


Using Eclipse
-------------

There are currently ``.project`` and ``.classpath-template`` files
stored in git in each component directory (e.g. :source:`common's
.classpath <components/common/.classpath-template>` and 
:source:`common's .project </components/common/.project>`). There is
also a top-level .classpath and .project file which contains the entire
project, but:

-  requires more memory
-  doesn't clearly differentiate the classpaths, and so can lead to
   confusion.

All the Eclipse projects require a successful build to have taken place:

::

       ./build.py

This is for two reasons. One, the Eclipse projects are not configured to
perform the code-generation needed. This creates the directory:

::

        COMPONENT/target

which will be missing from any Eclipse project you open before building
the source.

Also, Ivy is used to copy all the jar dependencies from
``OMERO_HOME/lib/repository`` to ``COMPONENT/target/libs``, which is
then used in the Eclipse ``.classpath`` files.

If Eclipse ever gets out of sync after the first build,
``./build.py build-eclipse`` can be used to quickly synchronize.

Unit testing
------------

The unit testing framework is fairly simple. Only methods which contain
logic written within the OMERO are tested. This means that framework
functionality like remoting is not tested. Neither is Hibernate
functionality; this is a part of integration testing. (see below)

Therefore, most of the code which is unit tested lies in the logic
packages of the server component. This is done using jMock.

You can run the unit tests for any component from its directory by
entering:

::

    ./build.py -f components/<component>/build.xml test

The same can be done for all components using from the top-level
directory with the command:

::

    ./build.py test-unit

Integration testing
-------------------

Integration testing is a bit more complex because of the reliance on a
database (which is not easily mockable), all Hibernate related classes
are tested in integration mode.

Running all tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run all the integration tests, use ``./build.py test-integration``
like the ``./build.py test-unit`` command above.

Running all the integration tests places several restrictions on the
environment:

-  There must be a running OMERO database.
-  An OMERO server instance must be running.

These tests could break for a number of reasons. Patience is needed.

Component tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is probably more straight-forward to run the tests for an individual
component. This can be done explicitly via:

::

     ./build.py -f components/<component>/build.xml integration

Results are placed in ``components/<component>/target/reports``.

Individual tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, you can run individual tests which you may currently be
working on. This can be done by setting the "test" attribute. For
example:

::

     ./build.py -f components/tools/OmeroJava/build.xml test -DTEST=integration/AdminTest
     ./build.py -f components/tools/OmeroPy/build.xml test -DTEST=test.t_permissions

Failing tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"test.with.fail" is the property which will

Writing your own tests
----------------------

For more information on writing tests in general see `<http://testng.org>`_. 
For a test to be an "integration" test, place it in the "integration" 
testng-group. If a test is temporarily broken, add it to the "broken" or 
"ignore" group:

::

     @Test(groups = {"integration","broken"}
     public void testMyStuff() {

     }

OmeroJava
~~~~~~~~~

The tests under ``components/OmeroJava/test`` will be the starting point
for most Java client-developers coming to OMERO.

These tests should assume that:

-  ICE\_CONFIG has been properly set. This means that
   ``omero.client client = new omero.client(); client.createSession()``
   should be usable with no further configuration needed.
-  A Blitz server instance is running on the host and port specified in
   the ICE\_CONFIG file(s).

::

    @Test(groups = "integration")
    public class MyTest {

      omero.client client;

      @BeforeClass
      protected void setup() throws Exception {
        client = new omero.client();
        client.createSession();
      }

      @AfterClass
      protected void tearDown() throws Exception {
        client.closeSession();
      }

      @Test
      public void testSimple() throws Exception {
        client.getSession().getAdminService().getEventContext();
      }

    }

OmeroPy
~~~~~~~

Similar to the OmeroJava tests, the tests under
``components/OmeroPy/test`` will be the starting point for most Python
client-developers coming to OMERO.

OmeroCpp
~~~~~~~~

TBD.

Internal server tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the external integration tests, there are a number of
internal tests in the "internal" component. These do not need to have a
running server and instead use an embedded Hibernate instance for
talking to the database. These tests require a significantly different
style, and are intended only for server developers. For more
information, please contact the list.

Documenting server code
-----------------------

The definitive documentation for all |OmeroApi|
code are the slice definition files. The Ice manual describes how to
write method and class comments:
`<http://zeroc.com/doc/Ice-3.3.1/manual/Slice.5.23.html>`_

Debugging a running OMERO instance
----------------------------------

By using the "debug" target from templates.xml, it is possible to have
OMERO listen on port 8787 for a debugging connection.

::

      bin/omero admin stop
      bin/omero admin start debug

Then in Eclipse, you can create a new "Debug" configuration by clicking
on "Remote Java Application", and setting the port to 8787. (These
values are arbitrary and can be changed locally)

**Keep in mind**:

-  The server won't start up until you have connected with Eclipse. This
   is due to the ",suspend=y" clause in templates.xml. If you would like
   the server to startup without your connecting, use "suspend=n"
-  If you take too much time examining your threads, your calls may
   throw timeout exceptions.
