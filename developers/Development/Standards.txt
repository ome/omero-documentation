Development Standards
=====================

Rationale and Vision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Various developers have been working on the OMERO project for up to 5
years. Each time the team grows\ :sup:`a`, we are reminded that the
project's development practices must be more mature and transparent. The
initial learning curve for new developers must be minimized.

In order for any of the aforementioned goals to be achieved there must
be better communication, better division of work and better management
and ownership of certain parts of the codebase.

These ideals are not just a function of project size, but a culmination
of factors including: geographically disperse developers (at least 9
time zones), increasing numbers of new developers, complexity of our
code base and the sheer amount of commit activity. In addition, we have
also seen increasing numbers of external developers who want to
*plug-in* to OME technology, maintainership gives them a clear
understanding of who to come to for support and direction.

Code cleanliness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is absolutely nothing worse or more infuriating than attempting to
review or look at messy code. Messy code is an absolute pain to debug or
review and just shows disrespect for other developers time. In short:

-  Intent should be clear
-  Methods should be well documented (yes, with Javadoc)
-  No one should require 1600x1200 resolution to read your code
-  Anyone should be able to see the entire method in one or two pages of
   text

All sounds rather vague doesn't it? What about <insert specific question
here>?

Well, we will have a *house* set of coding style guidelines that
everyone will adhere to without exceptions; you are not developing Perl
scripts in your basement to sort photos of your grandmother. This
*house* set of style guidlines will evolve over the next few weeks.
People are welcome to speak up for things that they would prefer or pet
peeves that they have. I will be pulling general wisdom from the
following:

-  ` Mozilla Coding Style
   Guide <http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/mozilla-style-guide.html>`_
-  ` Mono Coding
   Guidelines <http://www.mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines>`_
-  ` GNU Coding
   Standards <http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/index.html>`_
-  ` Linux Kernel Coding
   Style <http://kerneltrap.org/files/Jeremy/CodingStyle.txt>`_
-  ...

First versions of our coding styles are available from git at:

-  ` http://git.openmicroscopy.org/?p=ome.git;a=tree;f=docs/styles <http://git.openmicroscopy.org/?p=ome.git;a=tree;f=docs/styles>`_

Eventually all code will be formatted using these settings and the
` Eclipse 3.1+ <http://eclipse.org>`_ formatter.

Security
~~~~~~~~

Security is a both a personal interest of mine (Chris) and something
that I believe to be extremely important in software design. Moving to a
new set of frameworks and technology also gives us an opportunity to
rethink some of our priorities, security in particular. For almost the
duration of the OME project, security practices (access control, user
management, database authentication, etc.) have been poor or
non-existent. Now is the time to change that. Over the next few weeks I
will be adding to this page relevant talks and suggestions as well as
integrating these concepts into the code style guide.

For now, a few talks (okay... just one for now) from some Java security
professionals:

   Talk <http://xcon.xfocus.org/archives/2005/Xcon2005_Marc_Schoenefeld.pdf>`_

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Without good communication, all the other concepts fall down. To this
end, several weekly or monthly conference calls are arranged to report
on status. See
`http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/community/minutes/conference-calls <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/community/minutes/conference-calls>`_
for times and login information.

Under consideration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This list was initially a starting point for discussion for the
`http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/community/minutes/meetings/september-2008-dundee-developer <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/community/minutes/meetings/september-2008-dundee-developer>`_:

    The following topics are all **completely open** for anyone to add
    or veto (please don't delete). Some we already do, some are highly
    questionable. It is also unlikely that we would even be able to
    implement all such "standards" at once, but it would be good to have
    some guidelines as well as a list of things we would like to try for
    moving forward.

Client Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  icons (list of used icons to reuses)
-  communicates, warnings, buttons

   -  dialog boxes
   -  phrasing messages - options available, wording of buttons (yes/no;
      ok/cancel)

-  windows
-  style sheets
-  menu layout, title and content
-  keyboard shortcuts
-  use of hyperlinks (phrasing of link text, appearance, behaviour in
   terms of how the destination page/document is displayed)
-  tooltips
-  cursor appearance and behaviour
-  right click menus
-  single click, double click behaviour
-  drag/drop behaviour (if we ever use this?)

Structure
^^^^^^^^^

-  directory structure of the projects
-  how/where to store libraries and how to build ivy.xml
-  naming of package, file, etc. (conventions)

Coding
^^^^^^

-  templates (see in Insight/CodeTemplate? file)
-  logging
-  changes for the new version
-  Web validation: covering HTML, CSS, use of emerging Ajax-y type
   standards such as WAI-ARIA)
-  Java standards

   -  serialVersionUID
   -  equals/hashCode
   -  Mutability, thread-safety

-  Development process

   -  No new feature is coded without a ticket or wiki
   -  twitter is kept uptodate on which ticket or wiki page you are
      working on
   -  testing
   -  something about reading all new documentation and commenting if
      you don't understand or know if it pertains
   -  respond to hudson
   -  Checkin process **ticket or wiki is referenced from all commits in
      the form "wiki:link : ..."**

Licensing
^^^^^^^^^

-  README, license files (see in Insight/legal)
-  external licenses

Testing
^^^^^^^

-  how to build test story and report
-  web interface evaluation: list of user agents to test with

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  creating docs (see in Insight/docgen)
-  creating video How-tos (and associated transcripts, captions.)
-  case studies (i.e. stories of users using the relevant application to
   do something more efficiently, or do something new)
-  Documentation page for each feature with: video, documentation,
   "cite-as" statement.

Installation depends on the environment how to do it?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Environment - variable and requirement to prepare OS, for example:
   environmental variables, external software/packages, hardware,
   changes in the structure of directories, etc.
-  Dependencies - Any dependencies on other PI or Reference Data Request
-  Configuration - configuration and parametrization (properties files)
-  Database
-  Functional Instructions - Any functional instructions which should be
   done by administrator
-  Compilation - How people should compile
-  Run
-  Comments - Any comments

Updates
^^^^^^^

:sup:`a`: As for September 2008, roughly a dozen developers were working
on OMERO.
