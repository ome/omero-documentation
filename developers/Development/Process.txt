The OMERO Development Process
=============================

As decided at the May meeting in Dundee, the OMERO team is going to test
a new development process loosely based on Agile and XP methods.
**Stories**, **tasks**, and **defects** (our *ticket\_type*\ s) will be
entered into trac as necessary. These will be scheduled into **cycles**,
each of which consists of six **sprints** (a two week period). After
each bi-weekly period, we will schedule user-supplied stories, developer
supplied tasks, and outstanding defects to the upcoming iteration during
the **review meeting**.

A **Task** is a developer item (a "Todo") that will be scheduled by the
developer for technical reasons. **Stories** and **defects** are
scheduled jointly to a particular **milestone** (**cycle** & **sprint**)
and *will always be closed* by a successful **Test**.

**Tests** should be of the **Acceptance Test** form. The ticket number
for which a test is being written should be added in the
` testng <http://testng.org>`_ annotations (@Test( groups =
":ticket:`60` " )). This works at either the method
level (see
`SetsAndLinksTest#L73 </ome/browser/ome.git/components/common/test/ome/model/utests/SetsAndLinksTest.java?rev=662#L73>`_)
or the class level (see
`UniqueResultTest#L15 </ome/browser/ome.git/components/server/test/ome/server/itests/query/UniqueResultTest.java?rev=661#L15>`_).

If for any reason, a developer cannot fulfill the assigned stories/tasks
for an iteration, ... *that's ok*. It's two weeks, right? But by raising
a flag, we can get a feeling for our planning strategy. During the next
sprint, we should take that into account.

General Notes
-------------

-  Review meetings are a learning process.
-  Use views like `{9} </ome/report/9>`_ and `{11} </ome/report/11>`_ to
   get a feeling for what's going on.
-  Broad items can be left scheduled to the cycle.
-  Backlogged items are rescheduled.
-  The articulation of stories is critical; not too big, not too little.
-  Bigger stories can be left at the cycle level.
-  But, usually a story should be a testable piece of functionality.
-  Also, usually a stakeholder should write the story in order to push
   it forward.
-  Mid-sprint status by e-mail.
-  Generate material (movies/screenshots) at the end of a sprint.
   Movies/screenshots are attached to stories and to the corresponding
   milestone `milestone:OMERO-Beta4.3 </ome/milestone/OMERO-Beta4.3>`_

Review Meetings How To
----------------------

-  Before Meeting

   -  Try to close everything, or explain why still open.
   -  Review unscheduled and upcoming (next iteration) tickets.
   -  Move unscheduled tickets to cycle where sensible.
   -  Move cycle-unscheduled tickets to next iteration where sensible.

-  Scheduling

   -  Discuss what new came out of the closed tickets.
   -  Discuss why open tickets are open.
   -  Evaluate how well the previous iteration was planned.
   -  Move backlog (unfinished tickets) to next iteration or unschedule.
   -  Move other tickets to next iteration
   -  If next iteration is too full, prioritize and reschedule.

-  After Meeting

   -  Place review notes at
      ` http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/milestone/ <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/milestone/>`_\ <your-cycle-here>

Future directions
-----------------

It's possible that we add time estimates to the trac tickets and
beginning measuring our **velocity**. Currently, there is no way to do
this in trac.
