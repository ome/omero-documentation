OMERO.fs
========

The OMERO.fs service runs somewhere within
|OmeroGrid| and is responsible for watching a
particular filesystem directory for changes. These change events are
then signaled to any observers, who can optionally begin reading the
file once updated.

One critical use of OMERO.fs is watching a
directory and kicking off an automatic import. The configuration of the
DropBox system is covered on the :doc:`/sysadmins/server-fs` system administrator's page.

Another is allowing
system administrators to point OMERO at an existing directory without
requiring the data duplication required by a traditional import. 
This is now implemented as :doc:`/developers/FSlite/FSlite`.
