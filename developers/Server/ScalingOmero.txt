Scaling Omero
=============

There are several ways that OMERO, or any server system, can scale.
Optimizing your system for more than one of these factors is
non-trivial, but we try to lay out some guidelines below for what has
worked, what almost certainly will not work, and what -- under the right
circumstances -- might be optimal.

Concurrent invocations
----------------------

The bottlenecks for concurrent invocations are:

-  database connections
-  server threads
-  the router

Database connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Database servers, in general, have a maximum number of allowed
connections. In postgres, the default ``max_connections`` is 100, though
in many cases this will be significantly lower due to the available
shared memory (SHMMAX). If OMERO were to use direct connections to the
database, after ``max_connections`` invocations, all further attempts to
connect to the server would fail with "too many connection" exceptions.
Instead, OMERO uses a **connection pool** in front of Postgres, which
manages many more simultaneous attempts to connect to the database.

With the default ``max_connection`` set to 64,
it is possible to execute 500 queries simultaneously without database
exceptions. Instead, one receives server exceptions.

Server threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In :doc:`/developers/server-blitz`, too many (500+ on the default
configuration) simultaneous invocations will result in
``ConnectionLost`` exceptions. We are currently working on ways to
extend the number of single invocations on one server, but a simpler
solution is to start another :doc:`/developers/server-blitz` server.

Total throughput
----------------

The bottlenecks for throughput are:

-  maximum message size
-  server memory
-  IO
-  network
