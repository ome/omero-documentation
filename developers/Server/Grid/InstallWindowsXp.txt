Installing OMERO Grid on Windows XP
====================================

Unlike all other supported platforms, the ``bin/omero`` script and
|OmeroGrid| are not responsible for starting and
stopping the :ref:`server/blitz` server and other
processes. Instead, that job is delegated to the native Windows service
system. A brief explanation of doing this via the ``sc`` command is
provided below.

Limitations
-----------

-  This has only been tested on 32bit installations.
-  The processor.py functionality will not be available on Windows in
   milestone :milestone:`3.0-Beta3`. See :ticket:`1004` for more information.

Requirements
------------

First, all of the requirements on :doc:`/sysadmins/windows/server-installation`
should be fulfilled. The JBoss server should be able to contact 
a Postgres installation with an OMERO database. Then,

-  Install `Ice 3.2.1 <http://www.zeroc.com/download_3_2_1.html>`_from
   ZeroC_. The test installation used the
   `Ice-3.2.1-VC80.msi <http://download.zeroc.com/Ice/3.2/Ice-3.2.1-VC80.msi>`_
   package.
-  Install Python. The test installation used Python 2.5 from `Active
   State <http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads>`_.
   2.5 is required.

Configuration
-------------

Because all |OmeroGrid| paths must be absolute
under Windows, several files must be two files must be edited for server
to start properly:

**etc\\Windows.cfg**
    Configuration file appended to the ``icegridnode --Ice.Config=...``
    executable on Windows. Contains paths for log output, and for
    finding ``templates.xml``.
**templates.xml**
    Shared templates used in all |OmeroGrid|
    applications. The path definitions for both
    :ref:`server/blitz` and for ``processor.py`` must be made absolute.

Installation
------------

Installation is similar to the non-Windows platforms. From the
installation directory:

::

       python bin\omero admin start
       python bin\omero admin deploy
       ...
       python bin\omero admin stop

The first command installs |OmeroGrid| as a
Windows service with the name ``OMERO.master``, and then calls
``start``. Any further calls to ``admin start`` will fail since the
application is already installed as a Windows service. Simiarly,
``admin stop`` first stops the service, and then calls ``uninstall``.
This can also only be done once.

**All other interaction with the Windows service should take place via
``sc``.**

::

      sc start OMERO.master
      sc stop OMERO.master
      sc delete OMERO.master
      sc query OMERO.master

More information on the permissions necessary for the service, changing
the user it runs as, etc. are available under ``WINDOWS_SERVICE.txt``
under your Ice installation, most likely
``C:\Ice-3.2.1\WINDOWS_SERVICE.txt``

Using Windows GUI tools
-----------------------

Once the ``python bin\omero admin start`` command has installed the
**OMERO.master** service, you can use Windows service tools:

-  From the Control Panel

Services Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Then open the Services executable

.. figure:: /images/omerogrid-winxp-services.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Services

-  Here you can see OMERO.master running and also stop it

-  And can edit its runtime properties

-  Such as which user it starts as

Event Viewer Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Then go back to the Administration Tool window and open the Event
   Viewer

-  where status events from OMERO.master will registered (though the log
   output from the server is in the configured directory)

-  The server's running.

However, a bug in Windows will prevent the OMERO.master service from
being removed while the service GUI is open. Close the GUI to finish the
operation.
