OMERO events and provenance
===========================

What is an event?
-----------------

As described under :doc:`/developers/Server/Context`, each method
call takes place within a single application context (always the same),
session, and event. Of these, only event is guaranteed to be unique for
every task\*. The :source:`components/server/src/ome/security/basic/EventHandler.java`
creates a new

Events as audit log
-------------------

On each Database-update (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), an ``EventLog`` is created by
a ``HibernateInterceptor`` which is then saved to the database at the end of
the method call (in ``UpdateImpl``).

Relationship to ModuleExecutions
--------------------------------

The OMERO Event plays a similar role to the ``ModuleExecution`` in the
OME 2 system. They both contain time of create/update/deletion, status,
and type information. Event, however, has lost its ACL/permissions role.
These values have been moved to embedded values represented by the
Details object. Event also is not linked to all the created
``SemanticTypes`` as was ``ModuleExecution``, and so cannot fully
represent the provenance data needed by the ``AnalysisEngine``. At such
time as the ``AnalysisEngine`` is ported to Java, the
``ModuleExecution`` object will have to be added.

**\*** Here we say "task" and not method call, because all method calls
to a single stateful service instance belong to the same event. This is
the nature of a stateful service. Logically, however, it is a single
action.
