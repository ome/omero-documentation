OMERO Import Library
====================

The Import Library is a re-usable framework
for building import clients. Several are provided by the OMERO team
directly:

-  The integrated 
   :doc:`importer </users/client-tutorials/insight/importing-data>`
-  :doc:`/users/command-line-import` tool

Components
----------

The primary classes which make up the Import Library are:

-  :source:`ImportLibrary.java <components/blitz/src/ome/formats/importer/ImportLibrary.java>`
   itself, which is the main driver
-  :source:`ImportCandidates.java <components/blitz/src/ome/formats/importer/ImportCandidates.java>`
   which takes file paths and determines the proper files to import
-  :source:`ImportConfig.java <components/blitz/src/ome/formats/importer/ImportConfig.java>`,
   an extensible mechanism for storing the
-  :source:`ImportEvent.java <components/blitz/src/ome/formats/importer/ImportEvent.java>`,
   the various events raised during import to ``IObserver``\ and
   ``IObservable`` implementations
-  :source:`OMEROMetadataStoreClient.java <components/blitz/src/ome/formats/OMEROMetadataStoreClient.java>`,
   the low-level connection to the server
-  :source:`OMEROWrapper.java <components/blitz/src/ome/formats/importer/OMEROWrapper.java>`,
   the OMERO adapter for the Bio-Formats ``ImageReaders`` class
-  In OMERO.insight, the main entry point is the importImage method of
   :source:`OMEROGateway.java <components/insight/SRC/org/openmicroscopy/shoola/env/data/OMEROGateway.java>`.
-  In the CLI, the main entry point is the
   :source:`CommandLineImporter <components/tools/OmeroImporter/src/ome/formats/importer/cli/CommandLineImporter.java>`
   class.

Example
-------

The ``CommandLineImporter.java`` class shows a straight-forward import.
An ``ErrorHandler`` instance is passed both to the ImportCandidates
constructor (since errors can occur while parsing a directory) and to
the ``ImportLibrary``. This and other handlers receive ``ImportEvents``
which notify listeners of the state of the current import.
