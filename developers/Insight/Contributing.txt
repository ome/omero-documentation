Contributing to OMERO.insight
=============================

Getting Started with OMERO.insight
----------------------------------

Getting started with OMERO.insight entails that you have an 
:doc:`OMERO.server </sysadmins/server-overview>` already deployed.

Installing From Source
----------------------

Since January 2011, OMERO.insight code base is part of the OMERO code base. 
See :doc:`/developers/Development/UsingGit`, to check out code using 
`<http://git.openmicroscopy.org/>`_

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Install a Java 5 Development Kit (JDK), available from `Java SE Downloads 
   <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_ and
   required for both the OMERO server and client code. Set the ``JAVA_HOME`` 
   environment variable to your JDK installation.

Running Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is helpful to setup the project in `Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org>`_.

Build system
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ant
^^^

The compilation, testing, launch, and delivery of the application are
automated by means of an `Ant <http://ant.apache.org/>`_ build file,
located under the ``build`` directory (See :doc:`/developers/Insight/DirectoryContents`). 
Move to the build directory and, from the command line, enter:

::

    java build

This will display the available targets to compile, run, test, and
create a distribution bundle. Use the target you wish, for example:

::

    java build all

Because all the tools needed to build the software are already included
in the build directory, you do not need to have Ant on your machine. If
you wish to use Ant instead, you can still do it by using the
``build.xml`` file under the ``build`` directory. However, there are
some dependencies to satisfy before; these are clearly documented in the
``build.xml`` file itself.

For more details, see :download:`Software Build and Deployment </downloads/sbdd.pdf>`.

Jenkins
^^^^^^^

The OME project currently uses `Jenkins <http://jenkins-ci.org/>`_
(formerly known as hudson) as a continuous integration server
available :jenkins:`here <>` . OMERO.insight is built as part of the "OMERO-trunk" job :jenkins:`here <job/OMERO-trunk>`.

Jenkins checks for SVN changes every 15 minutes and executes:

::

    export JBOSS_HOME=$HOME/root/opt/jboss
    export JAVA_OPTS=&quot;-Xmx600M -Djavac.maxmem=600M -Djavadoc.maxmem=600M -XX:MaxPermSize=256m&quot;
