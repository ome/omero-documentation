Continous integration workflow
==============================

Definitions

Versioning
^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

	Major release

		What Sphinx_ calls a “version number” is defined on Wikipedia_ as a
		“minor number” and in OMERO is typically considered a major release,
		e.g. |version|.

	Point release

		Similarly, a Sphinx_ “release number” is a “revision number” on
		Wikipedia_ and an OMERO point release, e.g. |release|.

Labels
^^^^^^

Labels are applied to PRs on github under the “Issues” tab of each repository
(openmicroscopy.git_, bioformats.git_, scripts.git_, ome-documentation.git_)

The current release consists of PRs labelled with “|devbranch|”, which is the 
name of the branch which they will be merged into. This is work on the stable
release version which will only be released as a point release.

The next major release consists of PRs labelled with “develop”, which is also
the name of the branch which they will be merged into.

Objectives of document review workflow
--------------------------------------

Integrate and release changes in the documentation of the current release.
Improve review for next OMERO major release vs next OMERO point release.
Use this documentation review workflow as an example on how other review
workflows can and should function.

Proposal
--------

Maintain two development branches under the ome-documentation.git_ repository:

* |devbranch|, associated with current OMERO major release: |version|
* develop, associated with the next OMERO major release: |nextversion|

such that it is possible to release both the current point releases
immediately, while still working on more major releases by ensuring that
(nearly) all commits that are applied to |devbranch| are applied to develop in
order to prevent regressions.

Caveats include:

* more branches to manage, maintain and keep in sync
* PRs need to be opened against relevant development branch
* more integration jobs to run
* impact of OMERO documentation change on user base

.. _linkcheck_parser:

Linkcheck output parser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _Warnings Plugin: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Warnings+Plugin

The :file:`output.txt` file generated by Sphinx ``linkcheck`` builder is
parsed using the `Warnings Plugin`_. Depending on the nature of the links,
warnings are generated as described in the following table:

====== ============== ========
Type   Error code     Priority
====== ============== ========
local                 High
broken HTTP Error 404 Normal
broken HTTP Error 403 Low
====== ============== ========

The build is marked as FAILED or UNSTABLE if the number of warnings of a given
category exceeds a threshold. The table below lists the thresholds used for
all the documentation builds:

======== ====== ========
Priority FAILED UNSTABLE
======== ====== ========
High     0
Normal          0
Low             10
======== ====== ========
