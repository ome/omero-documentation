OMERO.grid
==========

To unify the various components of OMERO,
OMERO.grid was developed to monitor and control
processes over numerous remote systems. Based on ZeroC_'s IceGrid framework,
OMERO.grid provides an administration GUI,
distributed background processing, log handling, and several other
features.


Getting started
---------------

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

OMERO.grid is the basis of the regular OMERO installation.
If you have followed the instructions under  :doc:`Unix <unix/server-installation>`
or :doc:`Windows <windows/server-installation>`, then you
will have everything you need to start working with OMERO.grid.

IceGrid Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to exploring your IceGrid configuration, use

::

      bin/omero admin ice

It provides full access to the ``icegridadmin`` console described in
the ZeroC_ manual. Specific commands can also be executed:

::

      bin/omero admin ice help
      bin/omero admin ice application list
      bin/omero admin ice application describe etc/grid/default.xml
      bin/omero admin ice server list

Further, by running ``java -jar ice-gridgui.jar``
the GUI provided ZeroC_ can be used to administer OMERO.grid. This
jar is provided in the OMERO source code under lib/repository.

.. seealso::

    :zeroc:`Administrative Utilities <doc/Ice-3.2.1/manual/IceGrid.40.21.html#80724>`
        Chapter of the ZeroC_ manual about administrative clients

.. _grid_installation_windows_xp:


OMERO.grid on Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike all other supported platforms, the :file:`bin\\omero` script and
OMERO.grid are not directly responsible for starting and
stopping the :doc:`/developers/server-blitz` server and other
processes. Instead, that job is delegated to the native Windows service
system. A brief explanation is provided below.

::

       bin\omero admin start
       bin\omero admin deploy
       ...
       bin\omero admin stop

The first command installs OMERO.grid as a
Windows service with the name ``OMERO.master`` and starts it. Any further
calls to :omerocmd:`admin start` will fail since the application is already installed
as a Windows service. Similarly, :omerocmd:`admin stop` first stops the service, and
then removes it. See :doc:`/sysadmins/windows/service-tools`.

Further interactions with the Windows service can take place via ``sc.exe``.

::

      sc start OMERO.master
      sc stop OMERO.master
      sc delete OMERO.master
      sc query OMERO.master

More information on the permissions necessary for the service, changing
the user it runs as, etc. are available under ``WINDOWS_SERVICE.txt``
under your Ice installation, most likely
``C:\Ice-3.3.1\WINDOWS_SERVICE.txt``


How it works
------------

:zeroc:`IceGrid <>` is a location and activation service,
which functions as a central registry to manage all your OMERO server
processes. OMERO.grid provides server components
which use the registry to communicate with one another. Other than a
minimal amount of configuration and starting a single daemon on each
host machine, OMERO.grid manages the complexity
of all your computing resources.


Deployment descriptors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the resources for a single OMERO site are described by one
**application descriptor**. OMERO ships with several example descriptors
under :sourcedir:`etc/grid` . These
descriptors describe what processes will be started on what nodes,
identified by simple names. For example the default descriptor, used if
no other file is specified, defines three nodes -- "master", "node1",
"node2". As you will see, these files are critical both for the correct
functioning of your server as well as its security.

The deployment descriptors provided define which "servers" are started
on which "nodes". For example the
:source:`default <etc/grid/default.xml>` descriptor
configures the "master" node to start the :doc:`/developers/server-blitz` server, the Glacier2 router for
firewalling, as well as a single processor "Processor0". The master node
is also configured via
:source:`master.cfg <etc/master.cfg>` to host the
registry, though this process can be started elsewhere.

Deployment commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The master node must be started first to provide the registry. This is
done via the :omerocmd:`admin start` command which uses default.xml:

::

    bin/omero admin start

The deploy command looks for any changes to the defined descriptor
and restarts only those servers which have modifications:

::

    bin/omero admin deploy

Both ``start`` and ``deploy`` can optionally take a path to an application
descriptor which must be passed on every invocation:

::

    bin/omero admin deploy etc/grid/my-site.xml target1 target2

Two other nodes, then, each provide a single processor, "Processor1" and
"Processor2". These are started via:

::

    bin/omero node start NAME

at which point they connect to the registry to announce their presence. Now,
jobs can be run on any of the 3 processors. If a node with the same name is
already started, then registration will fail, which is important to prevent
unauthorized users.

The configuration of your grid, however, is very much up to you. Based
on the example descriptor files (\*.xml) and configuration files
(\*.cfg), it is possible to develop OMERO.grid
installations completely tailored to your computing resources.

The whole grid can be shutdown by stopping the master node via:
:omerocmd:`admin stop`. Each individual node can also be shutdown via:
:omerocmd:`node stop` on that particular node.


Modifying deployments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most common change that you will want to make to your application
descriptor is to add another processor. Take a look at :source:`etc/grid/default.xml`.
There are two nodes which are defined: **node1** and **node2**. To add
another processing node, simply copy the node element:

::

      <node name="node1">
        <server-instance template="ProcessorTemplate" index="1"/>
      </node>

and change the node name and the index number.

::

      <node name="MyNewNode">
        <server-instance template="ProcessorTemplate" index="3"/>
      </node>

The node name and the index number do not need to match. In fact, the
index number can be completely ignored, except for the fact that it must
be unique. The node name, however, is important for properly starting
your new processor.

You will need both a configuration file under ``etc/`` with the same name,
and unless the node name matches the name of your local host, you will
need to specify it on the command line:

::

       bin/omero node MyNewNode start

or with the environment variable ``OMERO_NODE``:

::

       OMERO_NODE=MyNewNode bin/omero node start

For far more information on using scripts, see the :doc:`/developers/Modules/Scripts`.


Securing grid resources
-----------------------

More than just making sure no malicious code enters your grid, it is
critical to prevent unauthorized access via the application descriptors
(\*.xml) and configuration (\*.cfg) as mentioned above.

.. _grid-firewall:

Firewall
^^^^^^^^

The simplest and most effective way of preventing unauthorized access is
to have all OMERO.grid resources behind a
firewall. Only the Glacier2 router has a port visible to machines
outside the firewall. If this is possible in your configuration, then
you can leave the internal endpoints unsecured.

|SSL|
^^^^^

Though it is probably unnecessary to use transport encryption within a
firewall, encryption from clients to the Glacier2 router will often be
necessary. For more information on |SSL|, see :ref:`security_ssl`.

Permissions Verifier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IceSSL plugin can be used both for encrypting the channel as well as
authenticating users. |SSL|-based authentication, however, can be
difficult to configure especially for within the firewall, and so
instead you may want to configure a "permissions verifier" to prevent
non-trusted users from accessing a system within your firewall. From
:source:`etc/master.cfg`:

::

    IceGrid.Registry.AdminPermissionsVerifier=IceGrid/NullPermissionsVerifier
    #IceGrid.Registry.AdminCryptPasswords=etc/passwd

Here we have defined a "null" permissions verifier which allows anyone
to connect to the registry's admin endpoints. One simple way of securing
these endpoints is to use the ``AdminCryptPasswords`` property, which
expects a passwd-formatted file at the given relative or absolute path:

::

    mrmypasswordisomero TN7CjkTVoDnb2
    msmypasswordisome   jkyZ3t9JXPRRU

where these values come from using openssl:

::

    $ openssl
    OpenSSL> passwd
    Password: 
    Verifying - Password: 
    TN7CjkTVoDnb2
    OpenSSL> 

Another possibility is to use the :doc:`/developers/server-blitz`
permissions verifier, so that anyone with a proper OMERO account can
access the server. (We are currently looking into providing a root- or
admin-only permissions verifier for public use.)

See :zeroc:`Section 39.11.2 Access Control 
<doc/Ice-3.2.1/manual/IceGrid.40.11.html#108430>`
of the Ice manual for more information.

Unique node names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only a limited number of node names are configured in an application
descriptor. For an unauthorized user to fill a slot, they must know the
name (which **is** discoverable with the right code) and be the first to
contact the grid saying "I am 'Node029", for example. A system
administrator need only then be certain that all the node slots are
taken up by trusted machines and users.

It is also possible to allow "dynamic registration" in which servers are
added to the registry after the fact. In some situations this may be
quite useful, but is disabled by default. Before enabling it, be sure to
have secured your endpoints via one of the methods outlined above.

Absolute paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Except under Windows, the example application descriptors shipped with
OMERO, all use relative paths to make installation easier. Once you are
comfortable with configuring OMERO.grid, it
would most likely be safer to configure absolute paths. For example,
specifying that nodes execute under ``/usr/lib/omero`` requires that who
ever starts the node have access to that directory. Therefore, as long
as you control the boxes which can attached to your endpoints (see
:ref:`grid-firewall`), then you can be
relatively certain that no tampering can occur with the installed
binaries.


Technical information and other tips
------------------------------------

Processes
^^^^^^^^^

It is important to understand just what processes will be running on your
servers. When you run ``start``, ``icegridnode`` is executed which starts a
controlling daemon and deploys the proper descriptor. This configuration
is persisted under var/master and var/registry.

Once the application is loaded, the ``icegridnode`` daemon process
starts up all the servers which are configured in the descriptor. If one
of the processes fails, it will be restarted. If restart fails,
eventually the server will be "disabled". On shutdown, the icegridnode
process also shutdowns all the server processes.

Targets
^^^^^^^

In application descriptors, it is possible to surround sections of the
description with ``<target/>`` elements. For example, in
``etc/grid/default.xml`` the section which defines the main
:doc:`/developers/server-blitz` server includes:

::

          <server id="Blitz-${index}" exe="${exe}" activation="always">
            <target name="debug">
              <option>-Xdebug</option>
              <option>-Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=${port},suspend=n</option>
            </target>

When the application is deployed, if "debug" is added as a target, then
the ``-Xdebug``, etc. options will be passed to the Java runtime. This
will allow remote connection to your server over the configured port.

Multiple targets can be enabled at the same time:

::

      bin/omero admin deploy etc/grid/default.xml debug secure someothertarget

Ice.MessageSizeMax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ice imposes an upper limit on all method invocations. This limit,
``Ice.MessageSizeMax``, is configured in your application descriptor
(e.g. :source:`templates.xml <etc/grid/templates.xml>`)
and configuration files (e.g.
:source:`ice.config <etc/ice.config>`). The setting must
be applied to all servers which will be handling the invocation. For
example, a call to ``InteractiveProcessor.execute(omero::RMap inputs)``
which passes the inputs all the way down to **processor.py** will need
to have a sufficiently large ``Ice.MessageSizeMax`` for: the client, the
Glacier2 router, the :doc:`/developers/server-blitz` server, and the Processor.

The default is currently set to 65536 kilobytes which is 64MB.

Logging
^^^^^^^

Currently all output from OMERO.grid is
stored in ``$OMERO_HOME/var/log/master.out`` with error messages going
to ``$OMERO_HOME/var/log/master.err``. Individual services may also create their
own log files.

Shortcuts
^^^^^^^^^

If the :file:`bin/omero` script is copied or symlinked to another name, then
the script will separate the name on hyphens and execute :file:`bin/omero`
with the second and later parts **prepended** to the argument list.

For example,

::

      ln -s bin/omero bin/omero-admin
      bin/omero-admin start

works identically to:

::

      bin/omero admin start


Symbolic linking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Shortcuts allow the :file:`bin/omero` script to function as a init.d script
when named "**omero-admin**\ ", and need only be copied to
``/etc/init.d/`` to function properly. It will resolve its installation
directory, and execute from there unless ``OMERO_HOME`` is set.

For example,

::

       ln -s $OMERO_HOME/bin/omero /usr/local/bin/omero
       omero-admin start

The same works for putting :file:`bin/omero` on your path:

::

       PATH=$OMERO_HOME/bin:$PATH

This means that OMERO.grid can be unpacked
anywhere, and as long as the user invoking the commands has the proper
permissions on the ``$OMERO_HOME`` directory, it will function normally.


Running as root
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One exception to this rule is that starting OMERO.grid as root may actually
delegate to another user, if the "user" attribute is set on the ``<server/>``
elements in :source:`etc/grid/templates.xml`.
(This holds only for Unix-based platforms including MacOsX. See
:ref:`grid_installation_windows_xp` for
information on changing the server user under Windows.)
