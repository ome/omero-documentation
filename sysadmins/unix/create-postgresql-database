On most systems, a "postgres" user will be created which has admin
privileges, while the UNIX ``root`` user itself does *not* have admin
privileges. Therefore it is necessary to either become the ``postgres``
user or use sudo as below:

-  Create a non-superuser database user and record the name and password. You 
   will need to configure OMERO to use your username and  password by setting 
   the omero.db.name and omero.db.pass properties (below).

   ::

       # For PostgreSQL 8.4.x and later
       $ sudo -u postgres createuser -P -D -R -S db_user
       Enter password for new role:       # db_password
       Enter it again:       # db_password

   .. warning:: 	 
       For illustrative purposes, the default name and password for the user 
       are ``db\_user``  and ``db\_password`` respectively. However, you 
       should not use these defaults values for your installation but use 
       your own choice of username and password instead.

-  Create a database for OMERO to reside in

   ::

       $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O db_user omero_database

-  Add the PL/pgSQL language to your database

   ::

       $ sudo -u postgres createlang plpgsql omero_database

-  Check to make sure the database has been created, you have PostgreSQL
   client authentication correctly set up and the database is owned by
   the **db\_user** user.

   ::

       $ psql -h localhost -U db_user -l
       Password for user db_user: 
               List of databases
          Name         |  Owner   | Encoding  
       ----------------+----------+-----------
        omero_database | db_user  | SQL_ASCII
        postgres       | postgres | SQL_ASCII
        template0      | postgres | SQL_ASCII
        template1      | postgres | SQL_ASCII
       (4 rows)

If you have problems, especially with the last step, take a look at
:doc:`server-postgresql` since the authentication mechanism
is probably not properly configured.
