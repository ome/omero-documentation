If you are running a Linux distribution such as Debian or Ubuntu and
have used APT to install the prerequisites then the installed software
will have been installed to locations in your file system according to
the Debian Policy Manual for software packaging. You can explicitly set
your environment variables to reflect these install locations by editing
the .bashrc (if on Linux) or .profile (if on Mac OS X) file which can be
found within your home directory. For example, as of writing, on Debian
& Ubuntu the following environment variables should be set:

::

        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun
        export JRE_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun
        export ICE_HOME=/usr/share/Ice-3.3.1
        export POSTGRES_HOME=/usr/lib/postgresql/8.4
        export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6:$PYTHONPATH
        export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/share/java:/usr/lib/:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/share/java:/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/bin:$ICE_HOME/bin:$POSTGRES_HOME/bin

Please note that the precise details of these environment variables can
change as new versions of software are released. You can retrieve the
pathname for a file by using the which command. So if you are unsure
what path to use in your environment variables, e.g. for the ICE\_HOME
variable you can execute the following command:

::

        $ which icegridnode
        /Users/ome/apps/OMERO.libs/bin/icegridnode

You can now set the ICE\_HOME path to something similar to
**/Users/ome/apps/OMERO.libs/bin** based upon the output from which,
e.g.

::

        export ICE_HOME=/Users/ome/apps/OMERO.libs/bin/icegridnode

As a last ditch effort, on a Linux or Mac OS X machine you can use the
find command to help you discover whereabouts something is located in
your filesystem. e.g.

::

        $ find / -name "icegridnode" 2>/dev/null

However this might take a long time to run, especially on a big
filesystem, so you might get a more timely solution by going to the
OMERO forums.

If the command gives no output then perhaps Ice is not installed, in
which case you should see the section above on installing Ice.

You can also add your OMERO bin directory to your path like so:

::

        export PATH=$PATH:path-to-your-omero-install-directory/bin
