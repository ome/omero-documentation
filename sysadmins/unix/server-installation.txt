        A guide provided by Janek Claus and Kenneth Arcieri (NIH/NICHD/UCSS) 
        for users wishing to install OMERO 4.1 on Mac OS 10.6, including
        details on how to build all dependencies from source. The OMERO 4.4
        and 4.3 installs are almost identical to 4.2 and 4.1 (except for web
        client), so this guide will still be useful.

Limitations
-----------

Installation **will require a "root" level account** for which you
know the password. If you are unsure of what it means to have a "root"
level account, or if you are generally having issues with the various
users/passwords described in this install guide, please see
:ref:`troubleshooting-password`.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. note:: The installation of these prerequisite applications is outside the scope of this document. For Linux distributions you should use the default package manager.

The following are necessary:

Java SE Development Kit (JDK) (1.5 or higher) 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Java SE Downloads are available from `<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_

UNIX systems, you can check which version of Java is 
currently available to you via your $PATH as follows:

::

    $ which java
    /usr/bin/java
    $ java -version
    java version "1.6.0"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0-b105)
    Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 1.6.0-b105, mixed mode)

Further, you can see if you have the Java compiler (Java SDK)
installed and available via your $PATH as follows...

::

    $ which javac
    /usr/bin/javac
    $ javac -version
    javac 1.6.0

.. note:: 

    On systems with `OpenJDK <http://openjdk.java.net/>`_ installed 
    by default, it will be necessary to unselect it and select the Sun 
    version. For more information, see :forum:`this thread  <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=273&p=572&hilit=openjdk#p572>` .

Python (2.4 or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check you have Python (and what version) by typing:

::

    $ python --version
    Python 2.5.1

Due to backwards incompatibilities in Python 3.0, Django does not
currently work with Python 3.0; for more information see the `Django
Installation page <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/intro/install/>`_.

The following are optional depending on what services you require:

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|l|l|

.. [1] May already have been installed as a dependency of Matplot Lib.

.. [2] Allows larger volumes to be viewed in the :omero_plone:`Volume Viewer <volume-viewer-in-omero.web>`.


Ice (3.3.x or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    **OMERO 4.4 supports Ice3.4**, but this requires the correct
    version of OMERO.server (see :omero_plone:`Downloads
    <downloads>`). See :faq_plone:`"Do I use Ice 3.3 or
    Ice 3.4?" <omero/do-i-use-ice-3.3-or-ice-3.4>` in
    the FAQ. If you have further questions, consult the `Forums
    <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/community>`_.


UNIX source downloads and binary packages are available from ZeroC_.
The latest compatible distribution is the `3.3.1 release <http://www.zeroc.com/download_3_3_1.html>`_. ZeroC does not provide binaries which work out of the box for Snow Leopard (Mac OSX). |Glencoe| has made its version available for the community:
`Ice-3.3.1-64.tar.bz2 <http://www.glencoesoftware.com/mac/10.6/Ice-3.3.1-64.tar.bz2>`_
(sha1=eeebd9865869bb513f2a5274a09aa498418bb4db) 

.. note::

    This version was compiled with the mcpp from MacPorts, which you will need to use these bindings. 

PostgreSQL (8.4 or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PostgreSQL installed and configured with PL/pgSQL and to accept TCP connections. PostgreSQL 8.3 and earlier are not supported. See :doc:`/sysadmins/limitations`. See :doc:`server-postgresql` for specifics about each version.

OMERO.server 4.4.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **OMERO.server** zip and *tar.bz2* is available from the 
:omero_plone:`OMERO downloads <downloads>` page.

Environment variables
---------------------

For the prerequisite software to run properly, your PATH, PYTHONPATH,
and (DY)LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variables must be configured. If
you installed via a package manager such as rpm, apt-get, or macports,
they should be set for you. If not correctly configured or if you
installed manually to /opt/Ice-... or a similar location, you will need
to set the values yourself.

.. include:: set-up-environment-variables

When performing some operations the clients make use of temporary file
storage and log directories. By default these files are stored below the
users HOME directory in ``$HOME/omero/tmp``, ``$HOME/omero/log`` and
``$HOME/omero/sessions`` (resp. ``$HOME\omero\tmp``, ``$HOME\omero\log`` and
``$HOME\omero\sessions``). If your home(\ ``~``) directory ``$HOME`` is
stored on a network, possibly NFS mounted (or similar), then these
temporary files are being written and read over the network. This can
slow access down.

The OMERO.server also access the ``$HOME/omero/tmp`` and
``$HOME/omero/log`` folders of **the user the server process is running
as** (resp. ``$HOME\omero\tmp`` and ``$HOME\omero\log``). 
As the server makes heavier use of these folders than the clients,
if the users home(\ ``~``) is stored on a network the server can be
slowed down. To get round this for the OMERO.server you can define an
``OMERO_TEMPDIR`` environment variable pointing to a temporary directory
located on the local file system e.g. ``/tmp`` (resp. ``C:\tmp\``).


Creating a database as root
---------------------------

Probably the most important step towards having a working server system
is having a properly configured database.

.. include:: create-postgresql-database

Location for the your OMERO binary repository
---------------------------------------------

-  Create a directory for the OMERO binary data repository. ``/OMERO`` (resp. ``C:\OMERO``)
   is the default location and should be used unless you explicitly have
   a reason not to and know what you are doing.

-  This is *not* where you want the OMERO application to be installed,
   it is a *separate* directory that OMERO.server will use to store
   binary data:

-  You can read more about the :doc:`OMERO binary repository <server-binary-repository>`.

   ::

       $ sudo mkdir /OMERO

-  Change the ownership of the directory. ``/OMERO`` \*\ *must* either
   be owned by the user starting the server (it is currently owned by
   the system root) or that user **must** have permission to write to
   the directory. You can find out your username and edit the correct
   permissions as follows:

   ::

       $ whoami
       ome
       $ sudo chown -R ome /OMERO


Installation
------------

-   Extract the OMERO tarball and note its location. Below it is referred  
    to as: ``~/Desktop/omero``

-   Optionally, review ``~/Desktop/omero/etc/omero.properties`` which
    contains all default settings.

    You will need to open the file with a text editor. Don't edit the file. 
    Any configuration settings you would like to change can be changed in the 
    next step.

-   Change any settings that are necessary using ``bin/omero config``
    (resp. ``bin\omero config``),
    including the name and/or password for the 'db\_user' database user
    you chose above or the database name if it is not "omero\_database".
    (Quotes are only necessary if the value could be misinterpreted by
    the shell. See :forum:`link <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=360#p922>`)

    ::

        $ cd ~/Desktop/omero
        $ bin/omero config set omero.db.name 'omero_database'
        $ bin/omero config set omero.db.user 'db_user'
        $ bin/omero config set omero.db.pass 'db_password'

-   If you have chosen a non-standard :doc:`OMERO binary repository <server-binary-repository>` 
    location above, be sure to configure the ``omero.data.dir`` property.

-   Create the OMERO database initialization script. You will be asked
    for the version of the script which you would like to generate, where
    both defaults can be accepted. Finally, you'll be asked to enter and
    confirm password for your newly created OMERO root user.
    
	.. warning:: 

	    For illustrative purposes, the default password for the OMERO rootuser 
	    is ``root_password``. However, you should not use this default value 
	    for your installation but use your own choice of password instead.

	    This should **not** be the same password as your Linux/Mac/Windows 
	    root user!
	
    ::

        $ cd ~/Desktop/omero 
        $ bin/omero db script
        Please enter omero.db.version [OMERO4.4]: 
        Please enter omero.db.patch [0]: 
        Please enter password for new OMERO root user: # root_password
        Please re-enter password for new OMERO root user: # root_password
        Saving to ~/Desktop/omero/OMERO4.4__0.sql

-   Initialize your database with the script.

    ::

        $ psql -h localhost -U db_user omero_database < OMERO4.4__0.sql


-   Before starting the OMERO.server we should run the OMERO diagnostics
    script so that we check that all of our settings are correct, e.g.

    ::

        $ bin/omero admin diagnostics

-   You can now start the server using:

    ::

         $ bin/omero admin start
         Creating var/master
         Initializing var/log
         Creating var/registry
         No descriptor given. Using etc/grid/default.xml


-  If you would like to move the directory again, see
   ``bin\winconfig.bat --help``, which gets called automatically on an
   initial install.

-  You can now test that you can log-in as "root", either with the
   OMERO.insight client or command-line:

    ::

        $ bin/omero login
        Server: [localhost]
        Username: [root]
        Password:         # root_password

OMERO.web and administration
----------------------------

.. note:: In order to deploy OMERO.web in a production environment such as Apache or IIS please follow the instructions under :doc:`install-web`.

Otherwise, the internal Django webserver can be used for evaluation and development. In this case, we need to
turn debugging on, in order that static files can be served by Django:

::

    $ bin/omero config set omero.web.application_server development
    $ bin/omero config set omero.web.debug True

then start by

::

    $ bin/omero web start
    Starting django development webserver... 
    Validating models...
    0 errors found

    Django version 1.1.1, using settings 'omeroweb.settings'
    Development server is running at http://0.0.0.0:4080/
    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
	
Once you have deployed and started the server you can use your browser
to access the OMERO.web interface:

-  `http://localhost:4080/ <http://localhost:4080/>`_

   .. figure:: /images/installation-images/login.png
      :align: center
      :width: 55%
      :alt: OMERO.webadmin login

      OMERO.webadmin login


Enabling movie creation from OMERO.
-----------------------------------

OMERO has the facility to create AVI/MPEG Movies from Images, which can
be called from OMERO.insight. The page :doc:`/sysadmins/omeromovie` gives details on how to enable them.

Post-installation items
-----------------------

Backup
^^^^^^

One of your first steps after putting your OMERO server into production
should be deciding on when and how you are going to :doc:`backup your
database and binary data </sysadmins/server-backup-and-restore>`. Please do not omit this
step.

Security
^^^^^^^^

It is also now recommended that you read the :doc:`/sysadmins/server-security` page
to get a good idea as to what you need to do to get OMERO clients
speaking to your newly installed OMERO.server in accordance with your
institution or company's security policy.

Advanced configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have the base server running, you may want to try enabling some
of the advanced features such as :doc:`/sysadmins/server-fs` or :doc:`/sysadmins/server-ldap`.
If you have ***Flex data***, you may want to watch :snapshot:`the HCS configuration screencast <movies/omero-4-1/mov/FlexPreview4.1-configuration.mov>`.
See the :feature_plone:`Feature list <>` for more advanced
features you may want to use, and :doc:`/sysadmins/server-advanced-configuration` on how to get the most out of
your server.

Update notification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your OMERO.server installation will check for updates each time it is started from the *Open Microscopy Environment* update server. If you wish to disable this functionality you should do so now as outlined on the :doc:`/sysadmins/UpgradeCheck` page.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My OMERO install doesn't work! What do I do now!?! Examine the :doc:`/sysadmins/troubleshooting` page and if all else fails post a
message to our :mailinglist:`ome-users` mailing list discussed on the :doc:`/users/community-resources` page.

OMERO diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want help with your server installation, please include the output of the diagnostics command:

.. literalinclude:: omero-diagnostics
