OMERO.server Linux installation walkthrough
===========================================

This page walks through the process of installing OMERO.server on a
machine using a Debian-based Linux distribution. 

.. note:: 
    This page is generally applicable to Debian and Ubuntu installations
    although there are some small differences which are noted when applicable
    during the walk-through.

Distributions
-------------

Whilst OMERO can be made to work on a wide range of Linux distributions,
installation using a package manager is the most straightforward way to
get an OMERO installation up and running. However, due to changes
between releases of Ubuntu and Debian, there are some restrictions over
which version of OMERO can be easily installed using the package manager
to install and manage the OMERO prerequisites.

================== ================= ==============
Distribution       ZeroC Ice version OMERO version
================== ================= ==============
Debian 6.0               3.3          4.3.x, 4.4.x
Debian 7.0               3.4              4.4.x
------------------ ----------------- --------------
Ubuntu 12.04 (LTS)     3.3, 3.4           4.4.x
Ubuntu 11.10           3.3, 3.4           4.4.x
Ubuntu 11.04             3.3          4.3.x, 4.4.x
Ubuntu 10.04 (LTS)       3.3          4.3.x, 4.4.x
================== ================= ==============

.. note:: 
    ZeroC_ Ice can always be built from source code for specific platforms.

In the remainder of this guide you should adjust version numbers to suit
the distribution that you are targeting.

Prerequisites
-------------

You require at least a clean minimal Debian or Ubuntu installation and a
non-root user account that has sudo privileges.

First we need to enable the contrib and Non-Free repositories by opening
:file:`/etc/apt/sources.list` in an editor, e.g. **$ sudo vim
/etc/apt/sources.list** and editing to add the following lines::

    deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/ squeeze contrib
    deb-src http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/ squeeze contrib

    deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/ squeeze non-free
    deb-src http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/ squeeze non-free

.. note:: 
    For Ubuntu the repository names and locations are different to
    Debian but you need to enable the **main**, **restricted**, **universe**
    and **multiverse** repositories. You can do this either by editing
    :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list` directly, in which case the entries already
    exist but are commented out, or using Synaptic (10.04 & 10.10) or Ubuntu
    Software Center (11.04 onwards).

Now we need to update our package lists to ensure that we get the latest
packages including those from the repositories that we just enabled::

    $ sudo apt-get update

Java
^^^^

From Ubuntu 11.10 and onwards, you can install OpenJDK 7 using::

    $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

For earlier versions of Ubuntu, Oracle recently changed their distribution
license (OSDL) which means that Debian and Ubuntu can no longer distribute
Java in their package management systems. This means that we have to install
the JDK separately as follows:

If you are on Debian then::

    $ sudo apt-get install lsb_release

For both Debian and Ubuntu you can now::

    $ sudo apt-get install git
    $ git clone https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6.git
    $ cd oab-java6/
    $ sudo ./oab-java6.sh

The script will run and you should see some output indicating progress.
When you get your prompt back::

    $ sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk

We also need to ensure that the Sun/Oracle JDK is the active one as we
end up with the OpenJDK also installed to satisfy dependencies along the
way::

    $ sudo update-alternatives --config java

and select the correct java from the displayed list.

OMERO dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we are ready to install the rest of our prerequisite software
packages::

    $ sudo apt-get install unzip build-essential mencoder
    $ sudo apt-get install python python-imaging python-numpy python-tables python-matplotlib
    $ sudo apt-get install zeroc-ice33
    $ sudo apt-get install postgresql
    $ sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-fastcgi

.. note::

    On Ubuntu 11.04 and earlier, ``python-tables`` does not install. We need
    to install ``liblzo`` otherwise OMERO.tables will fail to start::

        $ sudo apt-get install liblzo2-2

OMERO installation
------------------

Now that all of the prerequisites are installed and configured we can get
to the important business of setting up the OMERO.server. First we need
to create a home for our server and move into that directory. I like to
install certain software, such as OMERO, locally into a directory called
apps in my home directory as follows::

    $ mkdir apps
    $ cd apps
    $ mkdir OMERO
    $ cd OMERO

.. note::
    Recall that earlier we set the :envvar:`OMERO_HOME` environment variable
    to :file:`~/apps/OMERO/OMERO.server`. If you change the location that you
    wish to install OMERO to then you will also have to alter your
    :envvar:`OMERO_HOME` environment variable to reflect this.

OMERO |release|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Release versions of OMERO.server can downloaded from the
:omero_plone:`OMERO downloads <downloads>` page. Assuming that you downloaded
a release version of OMERO.server, extract it from the zip archive:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ unzip OMERO.server-|release|-ice33-byy.zip

Give your OMERO software install a nice local name to save some typing
later, to reflect what we set :envvar:`OMERO_HOME` to, and to make it easy to
manage the installation of newer versions of the server at a later date:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ ln -s OMERO.server-|release|-ice33-byy  OMERO.server

Development server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want the development version of OMERO.server, you can clone the source
code from the project's GitHub account to build locally:

::

    $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy
    $ cd openmicroscopy && ./build.py

.. note::
    If you have a GitHub account and you plan to develop code for OMERO then
    you should make a fork into your own account then clone this fork to your
    local development machine, e.g.

    ::

        $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/YOURNAMEHERE/openmicroscopy
        $ cd openmicroscopy && ./build.py

If you want the development version of OMERO.server, you can clone the source
code from the project's GitHub account to build locally::

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy

Alternately, you can download a
:omerojob:`daily build <lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/>` of the OMERO.server
from our continuous integration server.

Configuration
-------------

Environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edit your :file:`.bashrc` file, e.g. **$ vim ~/.bashrc** and add the
following::

    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun
    export ICE_HOME=/usr/share/Ice-3.3.1
    export POSTGRES_HOME=/usr/lib/postgresql/8.4
    export OMERO_HOME=~/apps/OMERO/OMERO.server
    export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$ICE_HOME:$POSTGRES_HOME/bin:$OMERO_HOME/bin
    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6:$PYTHONPATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/share/java:/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

.. note::
    You may wish to check postgres and python versions by
    checking the directories themselves, since they may not correspond to
    those listed above. In particular check the version of python that is
    installed. Newer versions of Ubuntu are installing python2.7 by default
    now from APT.

Now we need to make those changes take effect by getting our shell to
apply them using the **source** built in command::

    $ source ~/.bashrc

We can check that the new environment variables have taken by printing
their values to the shell, e.g.::

    $ echo $OMERO_HOME

should give output similar to the following::

    ~/apps/OMERO/OMERO.server

Database creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we need to configure our prerequisites so that they are ready for
OMERO to make use of. For the purposes of this walk-through we shall use
the following dummy data for the user account::

    U: db_user 
    P: db_password
    DB: omero_database

.. note::
    For a live or public server install these values should be altered
    to reflect your security requirements. You should also consider locking
    down your server machine but that is outside the scope of this document.

Setup postgresql::

    $ sudo -u postgres createuser -P -D -R -S db_user
    $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O db_user omero_database
    $ sudo -u postgres createlang plpgsql omero_database

Check that a database called "omerodb" has been created::

    $ psql -h localhost -U db_user -l

Update Postgresql host based authentication to accept remote
connections::

    $ sudo sed '/127.0.0.1/s/md5/trust/' /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf \
        > pg_hba.conf && sudo mv pg_hba.conf /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf

.. note::
    The backslash '' in the sed command above is used merely to
    indicate a line-break and should not be included in the executed command

Restart postgresql::

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

Use netstat to verify that there is something listening on port 5432,
this should be your postgre server::

    $ netstat -an | egrep '5432.*LISTEN'

Which should display a line similar to the following::

    tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5432          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN


OMERO.server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we can configure OMERO.server so that it can connect to the postgres
database::

    $ omero config set omero.db.name 'omero_database'
    $ omero config set omero.db.user 'db_user'
    $ omero config set omero.db.pass 'db_password'

.. note::
    If you altered any of these values earlier then you will need to
    change them to reflect your requirements

You can also check the values that have been set using::

    $ omero config get

Create a home for your OMERO data, I like to keep mine in
:file:`~/apps/OMERO/OMERO.data` so, within :file:`~/apps/OMERO/` use the
following command::

    $ mkdir OMERO.data

Configure OMERO to find the data location::

    $ omero config set omero.data.dir ~/apps/OMERO/OMERO.data

We can now configure the empty Postgres database using Omero's db
script. You can accept the defaults for the first few values and enter a
suitable password as required when prompted, e.g. "root\_password::

    $ omero db script

.. |sqlfile| replace:: OMERO\ |version|\ __0.sql

The output of this should be a file named, e.g. |sqlfile| file
in your current directory. We can now tell Postgres to configure our new
database

.. parsed-literal::

    $ psql -h localhost -U db_user omero_database < |sqlfile|

At this point you should see a whole load of output from Postgres as it
installs the new OMERO database.

If all has gone well, you should now be able to start OMERO.server using
the following command::

    $ omero admin start

You should now be able to connect to your OMERO.server using an OMERO
client such as OMERO.insight and the following credentials::

    U: root 
    P: root_password

OMERO.web
^^^^^^^^^

To connect with the webclient or webadmin using the included Django
development server::

    $ omero config set omero.web.application_server development
    $ omero config set omero.web.debug True

You should be able to start the Web server with::

    $ omero web start
    Starting django development webserver...
    Validating models...
    0 errors found

    Django version 1.1.1, using settings 'omeroweb.settings'
    Development server is running at http://0.0.0.0:4080/
    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
