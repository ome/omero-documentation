OMERO.server Windows Service
============================

OMERO.server installs a Windows Service to make the startup of the software
automatic at Windows boot time. When starting the server for the first time
an invocation to built-in Windows commands :command:`sc.exe` and
:command:`ntrights. exe` is made.

The :command:`bin\\omero admin start` command is a wrapper around a call to
:command:`sc create` followed by :command:`sc start`. In turn,
:command:`bin\\omero admin stop` is a wrapper around :command:`sc stop` and
:command:`sc delete`. Therefore, once :command:`bin\\omero admin start`
succeeds, it is possible to use all the regular Windows utilities, like
:command:`sc.exe` or the services manager, to stop OMERO.server without
having the service removed completely.

:command:`ntrights.exe` is used by the :command:`admin` component of
:command:`bin\\omero`. When the OMERO.server service needs to be run as a
different user, this command allows for modifying the `Log On` settings of
7the Windows Service.

Windows Services Manager
------------------------

To start the Services Manager, simply navigate to :menuselection:`Start -->
All Programs --> Accessories --> Run` (Windows 7). In the dialog, type in
:command:`services.msc` and select :guilabel:`OK` (see
:ref:`windows_run_services`).

   Run Windows Services Manager


This will bring up the Windows Services Manager. Here you can see
the OMERO.master service running and also stop it. Additionally the
:guilabel:`Log On` tab can be accessed here to configure under which user
name the service is started (see :doc:`server-binary-repository`).

Windows Event Viewer
--------------------

Windows Event Viewer allows for watching events occuring in the OMERO.server
service. To start the viewer, follow the same path as for Windows Services
Manager, but this time type in :command:`eventvwr.msc` (see
:ref:`windows_run_event`).

   Starting Event viewer

The status events from OMERO.master will be registered in the
:guilabel:`Application` view (though the log output from the server is in
the configured directory).
