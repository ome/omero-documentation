Using Windows GUI tools
=======================

Once the ``python bin\omero admin start`` command has installed the
**OMERO.master** service, you can use Windows service tools:

-  From the Control Panel

  :alt: Administration Tools

Services Tool
-------------

- Then open the Services executable

  :alt: Services

-  Here you can see OMERO.master running and also stop it

-  And can edit its runtime properties

-  Such as which user it starts as

Event Viewer Tools
------------------

-  Then go back to the Administration Tool window and open the Event
   Viewer

-  where status events from OMERO.master will registered (though the log
   output from the server is in the configured directory)

-  The server's running.

However, a bug in Windows will prevent the OMERO.master service from
being removed while the service GUI is open. Close the GUI to finish the
operation.
