OMERO.server binary repository
==============================

.. topic:: About

    The OMERO.server binary data repository is a fundamental piece of   
    server-side functionality. It provides optimized and indexed storage of
    original file, pixel and thumbnail data, attachments and full text 
    indexes. Its structure is based on :legacy_plone:`OMEIS <ome-server/system-overview/ome-image-server/>`.

Layout
------

The repository is internally laid out as follows:

::

    C:\OMERO
    C:\OMERO\Pixels      <--- Pixel data
    C:\OMERO\Files       <--- Original file data
    C:\OMERO\Thumbnails  <--- Thumbnail data
    C:\OMERO\FullText    <--- Lucene full text search index

**Your repository is not:**

-  The "database"
-  The directory where your OMERO.server binaries are
-  The directory where your OMERO.client (OMERO.insight, OMERO.editor or OMERO.importer) binaries are
-  Your PostgreSQL data directory

Repository Location
-------------------

.. note::
    It is **strongly** recommended that you make all changes to your OMERO
    binary repository with the server shut down. Changing the
    ``omero.data.dir`` configuration does **not** move the repository for
    you, you must do this yourself.
    Remember that ``C:\`` style paths must have backslashes escaped.
    We strongly discourage the use of network mapped drives as locations
    for either the binary repository or the OMERO.server installation.

Your repository location can be changed from its ``C:\OMERO`` default by
modifying your OMERO.server configuration as follows:

::

    C:\> cd C:\OMERO.server
    C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero config set omero.data.dir D:\\OMERO

The suggested procedure is to shut down your OMERO.server instance, move
your repository, change your ``omero.data.dir`` and then start the
instance back up. For example:

::

    C:\> cd C:\OMERO.server
    C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero admin stop
    C:\OMERO.server\> move C:\OMERO D:\
    C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero config set omero.data.dir D:\\OMERO
    C:\OMERO.server\> bin\omero admin start

Access Permissions
------------------

Your repository should be owned or accessible by the same user that is
starting your OMERO.server instance which may be different from the user you
use to start OMERO. See :doc:`service-tools` for more information.

To modify the access permissions to the binary repository, the :file:`OMERO`
folder properties can be accessed and the permissions settings changed
(see :ref:`windows_repository_perms`). Another option (useful for batch
permission changes) is the ``icacls`` (Windows 7) / ``cacls`` (Windows XP)
command line utility. Please note that the new permissions will appear as 
`Special Permissions` in the :guilabel:`Security` tab when viewing folder 
properties. An example invocation allowing the user `omeservice` to read (`R`) 
and write (`W`) from and to the ``OMERO`` directory:

::

    C:\>icacls OMERO /grant omeservice:RW
    processed file: OMERO
    Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

Locking and remote shares
-------------------------

The OMERO server requires proper locking semantics on all files in the binary
repository. In practice, this means that remotely mounted shares such as AFS,
CIFS, and NFS can cause issues. If you have experience and/or the time to
manage and monitor the locking implementations of your remote filesystem, then
using them as for your binary repository should be fine.

If, however, you are seeing errors such as NullPointerExceptions, "Bad file
descriptors" and similar in your server log, then you will need to use
directly connected disks.
