OMERO.server installation
=========================

.. seealso::

    :doc:`/sysadmins/server-upgrade`
         Instructions for **upgrading** your OMERO.server installation.

Limitations
-----------

Installation **will require a "root" level account** for which you
know the password. If you are unsure of what it means to have a "root"
level account, or if you are generally having issues with the various
users/passwords described in this install guide, please see
:ref:`troubleshooting-password`.

-  Unless you are clear on the differences, **you should also open all 
   consoles as an administrator to prevent file permission issues.**

       :alt:

-  Installation on Windows XP is not explicitly supported, especially
   for OMERO.web. Significant testing has taken place on Windows Server
   2008 and we recommend this version.
-  :doc:`/sysadmins/omeromovie` does not work on Windows at present.
-  Spaces are not currently supported in installation path names.

   .. note:: 
      The default user paths on Windows usually contain spaces so you
      will need to ensure the path has no spaces, ``C:\omero_dist`` for
      example.
-  A reboot is required after installing the prerequisites.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. note:: The installation of these prerequisite applications is outside the scope of this document. For Linux distributions you should use the default package manager.

The following are necessary:

Java SE Development Kit (JDK) (1.5 or higher) 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Java SE Downloads are available from `<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_

Python (2.4 or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to backwards incompatibilities in Python 3.0, Django does not
currently work with Python 3.0; for more information see the `Django
Installation page <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/intro/install/>`_.

Ice 3.4.x requires Python 2.6.x. You must download the 32-bit version
from `python.org <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/>`_.
As this is the "vanilla" python distribution (no extra libraries),
you will need to install further dependencies, making sure to
download the **correct bitness and Python version**:

*Python for Windows extensions*:  The installer is available from
`this page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/>`_.

The following are optional depending on what services you require:

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|l|l|

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Package
      - Functionality
      - Downloads

    * - Python Imaging Library
      - OMERO.web and Figure Export
      - `PIL page <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_

    * - Matplotlib
      - OMERO.web
      - `Matplotlib page <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_

    * - NumPy (1.2.0 or higher) [1]_
      - Scripting
      - `Numpy page <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_

    * - PyTables (2.1.0 or higher)
      - :doc:`OMERO.tables </sysadmins/server-tables>`
      - `PyTables page <http://www.pytables.org/moin/Downloads>`_

    * - scipy.ndimage
      - :omero_plone:`Volume Viewer <volume-viewer-in-omero.web>` [2]_
      - `Scipy page <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_

.. [1] May already have been installed as a dependency of Matplot Lib.

.. [2] Allows larger volumes to be viewed in the :omero_plone:`Volume Viewer <volume-viewer-in-omero.web>`.


Ice (3.3.x or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    OMERO |version| supports Ice3.4, but this requires the correct
    version of OMERO.server (see :omero_plone:`Downloads
    <downloads>`). See :faq_plone:`"Do I use Ice 3.3 or
    Ice 3.4?" <omero/do-i-use-ice-3.3-or-ice-3.4>` in
    the FAQ. If you have further questions, consult the `Forums
    <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/community>`_.


Windows installers can be found on the `ZeroC download
page <http://www.zeroc.com/download.html>`_ and will be called
something like ``Ice-3.4.2.msi`` (for Ice 3.4.2). If you plan to
develop for C++, be sure to read the instructions on the
|OmeroCpp| page.

PostgreSQL (8.4 or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PostgreSQL installed and configured with PL/pgSQL and to accept TCP connections. PostgreSQL 8.3 and earlier are not supported. See :doc:`/sysadmins/limitations`. See :doc:`server-postgresql` for specifics about each version.

The *One click installer* can be found on the `PostgreSQL Windows
download page <http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows>`_. You
will need the postgres user's password later in the install.

-  You must install PostgreSQL as a service if you want to follow
   this document; other PostgreSQL installation environments are
   supported but are outside the scope of this document.

#. Run the downloaded installer:

OMERO.server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **OMERO.server** zip and *tar.bz2* is available from the 
:omero_plone:`OMERO downloads <downloads>` page.

Environment variables
---------------------

For the prerequisite software to run properly, your PATH, PYTHONPATH,
and (DY)LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variables must be configured. If
you installed via a package manager such as rpm, apt-get, or macports,
they should be set for you. If not correctly configured or if you
installed manually to /opt/Ice-... or a similar location, you will need
to set the values yourself.

**Update your Windows environment variables: (REQUIRES RESTART!)**

#. Locate the *System* control panel page on the Start Menu under
   :menuselection:`Settings --> Control Panel`, open it and navigate to the *Advanced*
   tab (on Windows Vista the dialog will be visible after clicking
   the *Change settings* link on the *System* control panel page):

   .. figure:: /images/installation-images/system-properties.png
      :align: center
      :width: 35%
      :alt: Advanced System Properties

      Advanced System Properties
#. Open the *Environment Variables* dialog by clicking on the
   *Environment Variables...* button of the above dialog:

   .. figure:: /images/installation-images/environment-variables.png
      :align: center
      :width: 35%
      :alt: Environment Variables

      Environment Variables
#. Edit the existing *System* environment variable ``Path`` and add a
   new variable pointing to the Ice installation 'bin' directory. At
   the front of the ``Path`` variable also add a new string pointing
   to the Python installation directory (e.g. ``C:\Python26``). Then
   add a brand new *System* environment variable called
   ``PYTHONPATH`` pointing to the Ice installation 'python' location:

   .. |PATH variable| image:: /images/installation-images/path-variable.png
      :width: 33%
      :alt: Path variable

   .. |PATH variable 2| image:: /images/installation-images/path-variable2.png

      :width: 33%
      :alt: PythonPath variable


   |PATH variable| |PATH variable 2| |PYTHONPATH variable|

#. **Restart your computer**. For environment changes to take
   effect in background services, a restart is unfortunately
   necessary. See `<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/821761>`_
   for more information.

When performing some operations the clients make use of temporary file
storage and log directories. By default these files are stored below the
users HOME directory in ``$HOME/omero/tmp``, ``$HOME/omero/log`` and
``$HOME/omero/sessions`` (resp. ``$HOME\omero\tmp``, ``$HOME\omero\log`` and
``$HOME\omero\sessions``). If your home(\ ``~``) directory ``$HOME`` is
stored on a network, possibly NFS mounted (or similar), then these
temporary files are being written and read over the network. This can
slow access down.

The OMERO.server also access the ``$HOME/omero/tmp`` and
``$HOME/omero/log`` folders of **the user the server process is running
as** (resp. ``$HOME\omero\tmp`` and ``$HOME\omero\log``). 
As the server makes heavier use of these folders than the clients,
if the users home(\ ``~``) is stored on a network the server can be
slowed down. To get round this for the OMERO.server you can define an
``OMERO_TEMPDIR`` environment variable pointing to a temporary directory
located on the local file system e.g. ``/tmp`` (resp. ``C:\tmp\``).


Creating a database as root
---------------------------

Probably the most important step towards having a working server system
is having a properly configured database.

-  Create a non-superuser database user (make sure to note down the name
   and password) using **pgAdmin III**. You can find *pgAdmin III* on
   the Start Menu under :menuselection:`Programs --> PostgreSQL 9.1 --> pgAdmin III`:

   #. Double-click on the *PostgreSQL 9.1* database (or right-click and
      choose *Connect*) and provide your *postgres* user login password
      set during the installation, above.

         :width: 60%
         :align: center
         :alt: New login role

         New login role

   #. Create a new role and record the name and password. You will need to 
      configure OMERO to use your username and password by setting the 
      omero.db.name and omero.db.pass properties.

      .. warning::
          For illustrative purposes, the default name and password for the 
          role are ``db_user``  and ``db_password`` respectively. However, 
          you should not use these default values for your installation but 
          use your own choice of username and password instead.

         View installed languages
   #. If the ``plpgsql`` language is missing, right-click on the
      *Extensions* item and select the *New extension...* option in the
      menu. Finally, add the ``plpgsql`` extension, accepting all
      defaults. This will add both the extension and the language. In
      older PostgreSQL versions without extensions, right-click on the
      *Languages* item and select the *New language...* option in the
      menu. Finally, add the ``plpgsql`` language, accepting all
      defaults.

      New language name

Location for your OMERO binary repository
-----------------------------------------

-  Create a directory for the OMERO binary data repository. ``/OMERO`` (or ``C:\OMERO``)
   is the default location and should be used unless you explicitly have
   a reason not to and know what you are doing.

-  This is *not* where you want the OMERO application to be installed,
   it is a *separate* directory that OMERO.server will use to store
   binary data:

-  You can read more about the :doc:`OMERO binary repository <server-binary-repository>`.

   ::

       $ sudo mkdir /OMERO

-  Change the ownership of the directory. ``/OMERO`` \*\ *must* either
   be owned by the user starting the server (it is currently owned by
   the system root) or that user **must** have permission to write to
   the directory. You can find out your username and edit the correct
   permissions as follows:

   ::

       $ whoami
       ome
       $ sudo chown -R ome /OMERO


Installation
------------

-   Extract the OMERO tarball and note its location. Below it is referred   
    to as: ``C:\omero_dist``

-   Optionally, review ``C:\omero_dist\etc\omero.properties`` which
    contains all default settings
    
    You will need to open the file with a text editor. Don't edit the file. 
    Any configuration settings you would like to change can be changed in the 
    next step.

-   Change any settings that are necessary using ``bin/omero config``
    (resp. ``bin\omero config``),
    including the name and/or password for the 'db\_user' database user
    you chose above or the database name if it is not "omero\_database".
    (Quotes are only necessary if the value could be misinterpreted by
    the shell. See :forum:`link <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=360#p922>`)

    ::

        C:\> cd C:\omero_dist
        C:\omero_dist\> bin\omero config set omero.db.name omero_database
        C:\omero_dist\> bin\omero config set omero.db.user db_user
        C:\omero_dist\> bin\omero config set omero.db.pass db_password

-   If you have chosen a non-standard :doc:`OMERO binary repository <server-binary-repository>` 
    location above, be sure to configure the ``omero.data.dir`` property.
    
    When using ``C:\`` style file paths it is necessary to "escape" the 
    backslashes. For example:

    ::

        C:\> bin\omero config set omero.data.dir C:\\OMERO

-   Create the OMERO database initialization script. You will be asked
    for the version of the script which you would like to generate, where
    both defaults can be accepted. Finally, you'll be asked to enter and
    confirm password for your newly created OMERO root user.
    
    .. warning:: 

      For illustrative purposes, the default password for the OMERO rootuser 
      is ``root_password``. However, you should not use this default value 
      for your installation but use your own choice of password instead.

      This should **not** be the same password as your Linux/Mac/Windows 
      root user!

    .. parsed-literal::

-   Before starting the OMERO.server we should run the OMERO diagnostics
    script so that we check that all of our settings are correct, e.g.

    ::

                FLAGS              :

        Waiting on startup. Use CTRL-C to exit

    If you've chosen a non-default install directory (other than
    ``C:\omero_dist``), the output will look like this:

    .. parsed-literal::

        ...

-  If you would like to move the directory again, see
   ``bin\winconfig.bat --help``, which gets called automatically on an
   initial install.

-  You can now test that you can log-in as "root", either with the
   OMERO.insight client or command-line:

    .. parsed-literal::

        C:\\OMERO.server-|version|> bin\\omero login
        Server: [localhost]
        Username: [root]
        Password:         # root_password

OMERO.web and administration
----------------------------

.. note:: In order to deploy OMERO.web in a production environment such as Apache or IIS please follow the instructions under :doc:`install-web`.

Otherwise, the internal Django webserver can be used for evaluation and development. In this case, we need to
turn debugging on, in order that static files can be served by Django:

::

Enabling movie creation from OMERO.
-----------------------------------

OMERO has the facility to create AVI/MPEG Movies from Images, which can
be called from OMERO.insight. The page :doc:`/sysadmins/omeromovie` gives details on how to enable them.

Post-installation items
-----------------------

Backup
^^^^^^

One of your first steps after putting your OMERO server into production
should be deciding on when and how you are going to :doc:`backup your
database and binary data </sysadmins/server-backup-and-restore>`. Please do not omit this
step.

Security
^^^^^^^^

It is also now recommended that you read the :doc:`/sysadmins/server-security` page
to get a good idea as to what you need to do to get OMERO clients
speaking to your newly installed OMERO.server in accordance with your
institution or company's security policy.

Advanced configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have the base server running, you may want to try enabling some
of the advanced features such as :doc:`/sysadmins/server-fs` or :doc:`/sysadmins/server-ldap`.
If you have ***Flex data***, you may want to watch :snapshot:`the HCS configuration screencast <movies/omero-4-1/mov/FlexPreview4.1-configuration.mov>`.
See the :feature_plone:`Feature list <>` for more advanced
features you may want to use, and :doc:`/sysadmins/server-advanced-configuration` on how to get the most out of
your server.

Update notification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your OMERO.server installation will check for updates each time it is started from the *Open Microscopy Environment* update server. If you wish to disable this functionality you should do so now as outlined on the :doc:`/sysadmins/UpgradeCheck` page.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My OMERO install doesn't work! What do I do now!?! Examine the :doc:`/sysadmins/troubleshooting` page and if all else fails post a
message to our :mailinglist:`ome-users` mailing list discussed on the :doc:`/users/community-resources` page.

OMERO diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want help with your server installation, please include the output of the diagnostics command:
