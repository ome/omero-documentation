OMERO.server installation
=========================

.. seealso::

    :doc:`/sysadmins/server-upgrade`
         Instructions for **upgrading** your OMERO.server installation.

Limitations
-----------

Installation **will require a "root" level account** for which you
know the password. If you are unsure of what it means to have a "root"
level account, or if you are generally having issues with the various
users/passwords described in this install guide, please see
:ref:`troubleshooting-password`.

-  Unless you are clear on the differences, **you should also open all 
   consoles as an administrator to prevent file permission issues.**

-  Installation on Windows XP is not explicitly supported, especially
   for OMERO.web. Significant testing has taken place on Windows Server
   2008 and we recommend this version.
-  :doc:`/sysadmins/omeromovie` does not work on Windows at present.
-  Spaces are not currently supported in installation path names.

   .. note:: 
      The default user paths on Windows usually contain spaces so you
      will need to ensure the path has no spaces, ``C:\omero_dist`` for
      example.
-  A reboot is required after installing the prerequisites.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. note:: The installation of these prerequisite applications is outside the scope of this document. For Linux distributions you should use the default package manager.

The following are necessary:

Java SE Development Kit (JDK) (1.5 or higher) 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Java SE Downloads are available from `<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_

Python (2.4 or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to backwards incompatibilities in Python 3.0, Django does not
currently work with Python 3.0; for more information see the `Django
Installation page <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/intro/install/>`_.

Ice 3.4.x requires Python 2.6.x. You must download the 32-bit version
from `python.org <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/>`_.
As this is the "vanilla" python distribution (no extra libraries),
you will need to install further dependencies, making sure to
download the **correct bitness and Python version**:

*Python for Windows extensions*:  The installer is available from
`this page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/>`_.

The following are optional depending on what services you require:

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|l|l|

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Package
      - Functionality
      - Downloads

    * - Python Imaging Library
      - OMERO.web and Figure Export
      - `PIL page <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_

    * - Matplotlib
      - OMERO.web
      - `Matplotlib page <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_

    * - NumPy (1.2.0 or higher) [1]_
      - Scripting
      - `Numpy page <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_

    * - PyTables (2.1.0 or higher)
      - :doc:`OMERO.tables </sysadmins/server-tables>`
      - `PyTables page <http://www.pytables.org/moin/Downloads>`_

    * - scipy.ndimage
      - :omero_plone:`Volume Viewer <volume-viewer-in-omero.web>` [2]_
      - `Scipy page <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_

.. [1] May already have been installed as a dependency of Matplot Lib.

.. [2] Allows larger volumes to be viewed in the :omero_plone:`Volume Viewer <volume-viewer-in-omero.web>`.


Ice (3.3.x or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    **OMERO 4.4 supports Ice3.4**, but this requires the correct
    version of OMERO.server (see :omero_plone:`Downloads
    <downloads>`). See :faq_plone:`"Do I use Ice 3.3 or
    Ice 3.4?" <omero/do-i-use-ice-3.3-or-ice-3.4>` in
    the FAQ. If you have further questions, consult the `Forums
    <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/community>`_.


Windows installers can be found on the `ZeroC download
page <http://www.zeroc.com/download.html>`_ and will be called
something like ``Ice-3.4.2.msi`` (for Ice 3.4.2). If you plan to
develop for C++, be sure to read the instructions on the
|OmeroCpp| page.

PostgreSQL (8.4 or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PostgreSQL installed and configured with PL/pgSQL and to accept TCP connections. PostgreSQL 8.3 and earlier are not supported. See :doc:`/sysadmins/limitations`. See :doc:`server-postgresql` for specifics about each version.

.. include:: install-postgresql


OMERO.server 4.4.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **OMERO.server** zip and *tar.bz2* is available from the 
:omero_plone:`OMERO downloads <downloads>` page.

Environment variables
---------------------

For the prerequisite software to run properly, your PATH, PYTHONPATH,
and (DY)LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variables must be configured. If
you installed via a package manager such as rpm, apt-get, or macports,
they should be set for you. If not correctly configured or if you
installed manually to /opt/Ice-... or a similar location, you will need
to set the values yourself.

.. include:: set-up-environment-variables

When performing some operations the clients make use of temporary file
storage and log directories. By default these files are stored below the
users HOME directory in ``$HOME/omero/tmp``, ``$HOME/omero/log`` and
``$HOME/omero/sessions`` (resp. ``$HOME\omero\tmp``, ``$HOME\omero\log`` and
``$HOME\omero\sessions``). If your home(\ ``~``) directory ``$HOME`` is
stored on a network, possibly NFS mounted (or similar), then these
temporary files are being written and read over the network. This can
slow access down.

The OMERO.server also access the ``$HOME/omero/tmp`` and
``$HOME/omero/log`` folders of **the user the server process is running
as** (resp. ``$HOME\omero\tmp`` and ``$HOME\omero\log``). 
As the server makes heavier use of these folders than the clients,
if the users home(\ ``~``) is stored on a network the server can be
slowed down. To get round this for the OMERO.server you can define an
``OMERO_TEMPDIR`` environment variable pointing to a temporary directory
located on the local file system e.g. ``/tmp`` (resp. ``C:\tmp\``).


Creating a database as root
---------------------------

Probably the most important step towards having a working server system
is having a properly configured database.

.. include:: create-postgresql-database

Location for your OMERO binary repository
-----------------------------------------

-  Create a directory for the OMERO binary data repository. ``/OMERO`` (or ``C:\OMERO``)
   is the default location and should be used unless you explicitly have
   a reason not to and know what you are doing.

-  This is *not* where you want the OMERO application to be installed,
   it is a *separate* directory that OMERO.server will use to store
   binary data:

-  You can read more about the :doc:`OMERO binary repository <server-binary-repository>`.

   ::

       $ sudo mkdir /OMERO

-  Change the ownership of the directory. ``/OMERO`` \*\ *must* either
   be owned by the user starting the server (it is currently owned by
   the system root) or that user **must** have permission to write to
   the directory. You can find out your username and edit the correct
   permissions as follows:

   ::

       $ whoami
       ome
       $ sudo chown -R ome /OMERO


Installation
------------

-   Extract the OMERO tarball and note its location. Below it is referred   
    to as: ``C:\omero_dist``

-   Optionally, review ``C:\omero_dist\etc\omero.properties`` which
    contains all default settings
    
    You will need to open the file with a text editor. Don't edit the file. 
    Any configuration settings you would like to change can be changed in the 
    next step.

-   Change any settings that are necessary using ``bin/omero config``
    (resp. ``bin\omero config``),
    including the name and/or password for the 'db\_user' database user
    you chose above or the database name if it is not "omero\_database".
    (Quotes are only necessary if the value could be misinterpreted by
    the shell. See :forum:`link <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=360#p922>`)

    ::

        C:\> cd C:\omero_dist
        C:\omero_dist\> bin\omero config set omero.db.name omero_database
        C:\omero_dist\> bin\omero config set omero.db.user db_user
        C:\omero_dist\> bin\omero config set omero.db.pass db_password

-   If you have chosen a non-standard :doc:`OMERO binary repository <server-binary-repository>` 
    location above, be sure to configure the ``omero.data.dir`` property.
    
    When using ``C:\`` style file paths it is necessary to "escape" the 
    backslashes. For example:

    ::

        C:\> bin\omero config set omero.data.dir C:\\OMERO

-   Create the OMERO database initialization script. You will be asked
    for the version of the script which you would like to generate, where
    both defaults can be accepted. Finally, you'll be asked to enter and
    confirm password for your newly created OMERO root user.
    
	.. warning:: 

	    For illustrative purposes, the default password for the OMERO rootuser 
	    is ``root_password``. However, you should not use this default value 
	    for your installation but use your own choice of password instead.

	    This should **not** be the same password as your Linux/Mac/Windows 
	    root user!

    ::

        C:\> cd C:\omero_dist\
        C:\omero_dist> bin\omero db script
        Please enter omero.db.version [OMERO4.4]: 
        Please enter omero.db.patch [0]: 
        Please enter password for new OMERO root user: # root_password
        Please re-enter password for new OMERO root user: # root_password
        Saving to C:\omero_dist\OMERO4.4__0.sql

-   Initialize your database with the script.


    #. Launch *SQL Shell (psql)* from the Start Menu under 
    :menuselection:`Programs --> PostgreSQL 9.1 --> SQL Shell (psql)`

       ::

           Server [localhost]:
           Database [postgres]: omero_database
           Port [5432]:
           Username [postgres]: db_user
           Password for user db_user:

                  \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
                  \q to quit

           Warning: Console code page (437) differs from Windows code page (1252)
                    8-bit characters might not work correctly. See psql reference
                    page "Notes for Windows users" for details.

    #. Execute run the following to populate your database:

       ::

           omero=> \i C:/omero_dist/OMERO4.4__0.sql
           ...
           ...
           omero=> \q

-   Before starting the OMERO.server we should run the OMERO diagnostics
    script so that we check that all of our settings are correct, e.g.

    ::

        C:\omero_dist\> bin\\omero admin diagnostics

-   You can now start the server using:

    ::

        C:\omero_dist> bin\omero admin start
        Creating var\master
        Initializing var\log
        Creating var\registry
        No descriptor given. Using etc\grid\default.xml
        C:\omero_dist>
        [SC] CreateService SUCCESS


        SERVICE_NAME: OMERO.master
                TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
                STATE              : 2  START_PENDING
                                        (NOT_STOPPABLE,NOT_PAUSABLE,IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
                WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
                SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)

                WAIT_HINT          : 0x7d0
                PID                : 2312
                FLAGS              :

        Waiting on startup. Use CTRL-C to exit

    If you've chosen a non-default install directory (other than
    ``C:\omero_dist``), the output will look like this:

    ::

        C:\OMERO.server-4.4> bin\omero admin start
        Found default value: C:\omero_dist\var\master
        Attempting to correct...
        Converting from C:\omero_dist to C:\OMERO.server-4.4
        Changes made: 6
        No descriptor given. Using etc\grid\windefault.xml
        [SC] CreateService SUCCESS
        ...

-  If you would like to move the directory again, see
   ``bin\winconfig.bat --help``, which gets called automatically on an
   initial install.

-  You can now test that you can log-in as "root", either with the
   OMERO.insight client or command-line:

    ::

        C:\OMERO.server-4.4> bin\omero login
        Server: [localhost]
        Username: [root]
        Password:         # root_password

OMERO.web and administration
----------------------------

.. note:: In order to deploy OMERO.web in a production environment such as Apache or IIS please follow the instructions under :doc:`install-web`.

Otherwise, the internal Django webserver can be used for evaluation and development. In this case, we need to
turn debugging on, in order that static files can be served by Django:

::

    c:\omero_dist> bin\omero config set omero.web.application_server development
    c:\omero_dist> bin\omero config set omero.web.debug True
    c:\omero_dist> bin\omero config set omero.web.session_engine "django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache"
    c:\omero_dist> bin\omero config set omero.web.cache_backend "file://C:/windows/temp/"

then start by

::

    c:\omero_dist> bin\omero web start
    Starting django development webserver... 
    Validating models...
    0 errors found

    Django version 1.1.1, using settings 'omeroweb.settings'
    Development server is running at http://0.0.0.0:4080/
    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

Once you have deployed and started the server you can use your browser
to access the OMERO.web interface:

-  `http://localhost:4080/ <http://localhost:4080/>`_

   .. figure:: /images/installation-images/login.png

Enabling movie creation from OMERO.
-----------------------------------

OMERO has the facility to create AVI/MPEG Movies from Images, which can
be called from OMERO.insight. The page :doc:`/sysadmins/omeromovie` gives details on how to enable them.

Post-installation items
-----------------------

Backup
^^^^^^

One of your first steps after putting your OMERO server into production
should be deciding on when and how you are going to :doc:`backup your
database and binary data </sysadmins/server-backup-and-restore>`. Please do not omit this
step.

Security
^^^^^^^^

It is also now recommended that you read the :doc:`/sysadmins/server-security` page
to get a good idea as to what you need to do to get OMERO clients
speaking to your newly installed OMERO.server in accordance with your
institution or company's security policy.

Advanced configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have the base server running, you may want to try enabling some
of the advanced features such as :doc:`/sysadmins/server-fs` or :doc:`/sysadmins/server-ldap`.
If you have ***Flex data***, you may want to watch :snapshot:`the HCS configuration screencast <movies/omero-4-1/mov/FlexPreview4.1-configuration.mov>`.
See the :feature_plone:`Feature list <>` for more advanced
features you may want to use, and :doc:`/sysadmins/server-advanced-configuration` on how to get the most out of
your server.

Update notification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your OMERO.server installation will check for updates each time it is started from the *Open Microscopy Environment* update server. If you wish to disable this functionality you should do so now as outlined on the :doc:`/sysadmins/UpgradeCheck` page.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My OMERO install doesn't work! What do I do now!?! Examine the :doc:`/sysadmins/troubleshooting` page and if all else fails post a
message to our :mailinglist:`ome-users` mailing list discussed on the :doc:`/users/community-resources` page.

OMERO diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want help with your server installation, please include the output of the diagnostics command:

.. literalinclude:: omero-diagnostics
