Known Limitations

Synchronisation of lib/scripts
==============================

Since 4.2.0, OMERO includes a significantly improved scripting system. Several 
official scripts are shipped under lib/scripts in the deployment directory. If 
any of your users adds their own "official scripts", they too will be stored 
under lib/scripts. When we release a new OMERO version, there will be some
difficulties merging the two directories.

A github repository is now available under
`<https://github.com/ome/scripts>`_ which provides help for merging
your lib/scripts directories. For more information, see :faq_plone:`"How do I
make lib/scripts a git repository?" 
<omero/how-do-i-make-lib-scripts-a-git-repository>`
in the FAQ.

Building OMERO.cpp 4.4.x under Windows with Ice 3.4 fails.
==========================================================

ValueError: filedescriptor out of range in select() when increasing the number of available filehandles via 'ulimit -n'
=======================================================================================================================

This is a known issue in Python versions prior to 2.7.0. See
:ticket:`6201` and Python `Issue #3392
<http://bugs.python.org/issue3392>`_ for more details.

DeltaVision OMX files (.hdr) files not viewable
===============================================

Some files generated by an OMX system have a pixel type of float and a
large dynamic range. While the files import into OMERO they are
currently not viewable. This fix would require deep changes to several
parts of the code and we have chosen not to make the changes yet. See
:ticket:`3256`.

OMERO.web 'development server' does not work under Windows XP
=============================================================

The development server included with OMERO.web does not work under
Windows XP. This server is included to allow you to easily evaluate
and develop the OMERO.web component. As it should not be used in a
production environment, while an inconvenience, this should not stop
the deployment of a production version of OMERO.web. See :forum:`OME forum
topic <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=640>`.

Importing using desktop clients and number of files to import
=============================================================

It is preferable not to import more than 1000 image files in a single
import.

Importing using desktop clients on Ubuntu
=========================================

Under older Ubuntu installations the 'import folder' option currently
does not work.

Comment annotations and OMERO.clients
=====================================

If you wish to add a large comment to an object (e.g. an Image), it is
preferable to attach a file i.e. use ``FileAnnotation``.

Not finding certain pieces of data in wildcard searches
=======================================================

Sometimes data is missed when certain types of wildcard searches are
performed. You can find further details on :ticket:`3164`.

C++ compilation problems on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
========================================================

Under certain circumstances building OmeroCpp on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow
Leopard) can fail with "ld: symbol(s) not found". You can find further
details, a potential solution and make any comments on your experience
with the problem on :ticket:`3210`.

Web Start problems on Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)
===================================================

The new security features in Mac OS X 10.8 prevent users from launching
OMERO.insight via Java Web Start using the standard system security
settings. The system wide setting needs to be changed in preferences,
and this would have security implications. We are looking into code 
signing to resolve this issue.

Synchronising with LDAP
=======================

Enabling synchronisation of LDAP on user login will result in LDAP
being treated as the authority on both group membership and also the
available groups. Any groups defined in OMERO and not in LDAP will
result in users being removed from these groups. The groups will still
exist in OMERO but user membership will be treated as being defined by
LDAP alone.

Binary delete on Windows servers
================================

On Windows servers not all binary files corresponding to a delete may
be removed from the binary repository. See 
:ref:`DeleteBinaryData` for more details.


Previous known issues (Prior to |release|)
==========================================


PostgreSQL 9.x defaults to 'hex' bytea\_output format
-----------------------------------------------------

Newer versions of PostgreSQL default to the 'hex' as opposed to 'escape'
format for bytea\_output which OMERO uses for storing script and share
data in the database. This causes problems with OMERO 4.3 and earlier, which
cannot understand this format. OMERO 4.4 works with both formats
without problems. A workaround is available under
:doc:`/sysadmins/unix/server-postgresql`. See :ticket:`5662`.


Non-LDAP user password security
-------------------------------

Encrypted login and communication, via |SSL|, has been available in
OMERO for some time. However, under some circumstances it is possible
for passwords to end up on the wire in the clear. Further details and
status can be found on :ticket:`3232`. Users who have their
credentials stored in LDAP and who have OMERO configured to use their
LDAP server are **not** affected by this issue.


Moving data between groups
--------------------------

Prior to OMERO 4.4, users cannot move data between groups. We
encourage users to be aware of their **working group** at all times,
especially when importing.


Import of reagents and screens
------------------------------

The import of some, complicated OME-XML files may not work with
4.2.0. Shortly before release, we tested a file with two entire
screens, several plates, and many cross linked reagents which
failed. This is a very unlikely scenario, and we know of no files that
contain this level of data, but if you have issues getting screening
data imported in the OME-XML format, please :community_plone:`let us know
<>`.
