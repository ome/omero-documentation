A short decription on how to create movies from OMERO.

Creating a movie from OMERO
---------------------------

OMERO provides a script to make Mpeg or Quicktime movies from any image
in the server. These movies are created by a script called makemovie.py,
this script has a number of options: these include: selecting a range of
Z,T planes, the channels to display. The movie can also show information
overlayed over the image: z-section, scale bar and timing.

The resulting movie will then be uploaded to the server by the script
and become a file attachment to the source image.

Viewing the movie
-----------------

The make movie script allows you to save the movie in two different
formats, a DivX encoded AVI and Quicktime movie. To view the AVI you may
need to install a divX codec from ` DivX <http://www.divx.com/>`_. It
should be noted that the DivX avi is normally 1/3 to 1/10 the size of
the Quicktime movie.

Installing the make movie script
--------------------------------

The make movie script currently uses the `mencoder <http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html>`_ utility to
encode the movies, this command should be in the path of the
computer (icegrid node) running the script.

You can find windows installs for mencoder at
`<http://sourceforge.net/projects/mplayer-win32/files/>`_

We have :snapshot:`Mac OSX installs for mencoder <mencoder/mac/>`
which were originally provided
`here <http://stefpause.com/apple/mac/mplayer-os-x-10rc1-and-mencoder-binaries/>`__.
Unzip and put the mencoder in the PATH available to the server, e.g.
/usr/local/bin/ . You may need to restart the server for this to take
effect.

There are also macports, rpms and debs for mencoder.

Make movie also uses\ `Python Imaging
Library`_ and `numpy <http://www.scipy.org/Download>`_.

Make movie command arguments
----------------------------

A detailed list of the commands accepted by the script are:

-  imageId: This id of the image to create the movie from
-  output: The name of the output file, sans the extension
-  zStart: The starting z-section to create the movie from
-  zEnd: The final z-section
-  tStart: The starting timepoint to create the movie
-  tEnd: The final timepoint.
-  channels: The list of channels to use in the movie (index, from 0)
-  splitView: Should we show the split view in the movie (not available yet)
-  showTime: Show the average time of the aquisition of the channels in the frame.
-  showPlaneInfo: Show the time and z-section of the current frame.
-  fps: The number of frames per second of the movie
-  scalebar: The scalebar size in microns, if <=0 will not show scale bar.
-  format: The format of the movie to be created currently supports 'video/mpeg', 'video/quicktime'
-  overlayColour: The colour of the overlays, scalebar, time, as int(RGB)
-  fileAnnotation: The fileAnnotation id of the uploaded movie. (return value from script)

Platform-specific notes
-----------------------

Windows
~~~~~~~

For Windows, you can download a "MPlayer-rtm-svm-<version>" bundle from
` http://sourceforge.net/projects/mplayer-win32/ <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mplayer-win32/>`_.
You will need ` 7zip <http://www.7-zip.org/download.html>`_ to open the
bundle. Then you will need to add the directory containing
"mencoder.exe" to your system path and restart.
