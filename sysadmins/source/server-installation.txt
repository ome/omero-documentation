OMERO.server Installation
=========================

.. seealso::

    :ref:`sysadmins/server-upgrade`
         Instructions for **upgrading** your OMERO.server installation.

    :snapshot:`OMERO Installation for Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) <omero/osx/Omero-MacInstalltionGuide-ver214.pdf>`
        A guide provided by Janek Claus and Kenneth Arcieri (NIH/NICHD/UCSS) 
        for users wishing to install OMERO 4.1 on Mac OS 10.6, including
        details on how to build all dependencies from source. The OMERO 4.4
        and 4.3 installs are almost identical to 4.2 and 4.1 (except for web
        client), so this guide will still be useful.

        A guide provided by Caterina Strambio De Castillia and Vanni Galli (University of Geneva/SUPSI in Lugano) for users wishing to install OMERO 4.1.1 or 4.2.0 on CentOS.


Limitations
-----------

Installation **will require a "root" level account** for which you know the password. If you are unsure of what it means to have a "root" level account, or if you are generally having issues with the various users/passwords described in this install guide, please see :ref:`sysadmins/troubleshooting/password`.

.. only:: windows

    -  Unless you are clear on the differences, **you should also open all 
       consoles as an administrator to prevent file permission issues.**

        .. figure:: /images/installation-images/win7-runasadmin-highlight.png
           :align: center
           :alt:

    -  Installation on Windows XP is not explicitly supported, especially
       for OMERO.web. Significant testing has taken place on Windows Server
       2008 and we recommend this version.
    -  :ref:`sysadmins/omeromovie` does not work on Windows at present.
    -  Spaces are not currently supported in installation path names.

       .. note:: 
          The default user paths on Windows usually contain spaces so you
          will need to ensure the path has no spaces, ``C:\omero_dist`` for
          example.
    -  A reboot is required after installing the prerequisites.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. note:: The installation of these prerequisite applications is outside the scope of this document. For Linux distributions you should use the default package manager.

The following are necessary:

Java SE Development Kit (JDK) (1.5 or higher) 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Java SE Downloads are available from `<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_

.. only:: unix
    
    UNIX systems, you can check which version of Java is 
    currently available to you via your $PATH as follows:

    ::

        $ which java
        /usr/bin/java
        $ java -version
        java version "1.6.0"
        Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0-b105)
        Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 1.6.0-b105, mixed mode)

    Further, you can see if you have the Java compiler (Java SDK)
    installed and available via your $PATH as follows...

    ::

        $ which javac
        /usr/bin/javac
        $ javac -version
        javac 1.6.0

    .. note:: 

        On systems with `OpenJDK <http://openjdk.java.net/>`_ installed 
        by default, it will be necessary to unselect it and select the Sun 
        version. For more information, see :forum:`this thread  <viewtopic.php?f=5&t=273&p=572&hilit=openjdk#p572>` .

Python (2.4 or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. only:: unix

    Check you have Python (and what version) by typing:

    ::

        $ python --version
        Python 2.5.1

Due to backwards incompatibilities in Python 3.0, Django does not
currently work with Python 3.0; for more information see the `Django
Installation page <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/intro/install/>`_.

.. only:: windows

    Ice 3.4.x requires Python 2.6.x. You must download the 32-bit version
    from `python.org <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/>`_.
    As this is the "vanilla" python distribution (no extra libraries),
    you will need to install further dependencies, making sure to
    download the **correct bitness and Python version**:

    *Python for Windows extensions*:  The installer is available from
    `this page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/>`_.

The following are optional depending on what services you require:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Package
      - Functionality
      - Downloads

    * - Python Imaging Library
      - OMERO.web and Figure Export
      - `PIL page <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_

    * - Matplotlib [1]_
      - OMERO.web
      - `Matplotlib page <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_

    * - NumPy (1.2.0 or higher)
      - Scripting
      - `Numpy page <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_

    * - PyTables (2.1.0 or higher)
      - :wiki:`OMERO.Tables <OmeroTables>`
      - `PyTables page <http://www.pytables.org/moin/Downloads>`_

    * - scipy.ndimage
      - :plone:`Volume Viewer <products/omero/volume-viewer-in-omero.web>` [2]_
      - `Scipy page <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_

.. [1] May already have been installed as a dependency of Matplot Lib.

.. [2] Allows larger volumes to be viewed in the :plone:`Volume Viewer   <products/omero/volume-viewer-in-omero.web>`.


Ice (3.3.x or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    **OMERO 4.4 supports Ice3.4**, but this requires the correct
    version of OMERO.server (see :plone:`Downloads
    <support/omero4/downloads>`). See :plone:`"Do I use Ice 3.3 or
    Ice 3.4?" <support/faq/omero/do-i-use-ice-3.3-or-ice-3.4>` in
    the FAQ. If you have further questions, consult the `Forums
    <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/community>`_.

.. only:: unix

    UNIX source downloads and binary packages are available from ZeroC_.
    The latest compatible distribution is the `3.3.1 release <http://www.zeroc.com/download_3_3_1.html>`_. ZeroC does not provide binaries which work out of the box for Snow Leopard (Mac OSX). Glencoe Software has made its version available for the community:
    `Ice-3.3.1-64.tar.bz2 <http://www.glencoesoftware.com/mac/10.6/Ice-3.3.1-64.tar.bz2>`_
    (sha1=eeebd9865869bb513f2a5274a09aa498418bb4db) 

    .. note::

        This version was compiled with the mcpp from MacPorts, which you will need to use these bindings. 

.. only:: windows

    Windows installers can be found on the `ZeroC download
    page <http://www.zeroc.com/download.html>`_ and will be called
    something like ``Ice-3.4.2.msi`` (for Ice 3.4.2). If you plan to
    develop for C++, be sure to read the instructions on the
    :wiki:`OmeroCpp` page.

PostgreSQL (8.4 or higher)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PostgreSQL installed and configured with PL/pgSQL and to accept TCP connections. PostgreSQL 8.3 and earlier are not supported. See :ref:`users/limitations`. See :doc:`server-postgresql` for specifics about each version.

.. only:: windows

    The *One click installer* can be found on the `PostgreSQL Windows
    download page <http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows>`_. You
    will need the postgres user's password later in the install.

    -  You must install PostgreSQL as a service if you want to follow
       this document; other PostgreSQL installation environments are
       supported but are outside the scope of this document.

    #. Run the downloaded installer:

OMERO.server 4.4.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **OMERO.server** zip and *tar.bz2* is available from the 
:plone:`OMERO downloads <support/omero4/downloads>` page.

Environment Variables
---------------------

For the prerequisite software to run properly, your PATH, PYTHONPATH,
and (DY)LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variables must be configured. If
you installed via a package manager such as rpm, apt-get, or macports,
they should be set for you. If not correctly configured or if you
installed manually to /opt/Ice-... or a similar location, you will need
to set the values yourself.

.. only:: unix

    If you are running a Linux distribution such as Debian or Ubuntu and
    have used APT to install the prerequisites then the installed software
    will have been installed to locations in your file system according to
    the Debian Policy Manual for software packaging. You can explicitly set
    your environment variables to reflect these install locations by editing
    the .bashrc (if on Linux) or .profile (if on Mac OS X) file which can be
    found within your home directory. For example, as of writing, on Debian
    & Ubuntu the following environment variables should be set:

    ::

            export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun
            export JRE_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun
            export ICE_HOME=/usr/share/Ice-3.3.1
            export POSTGRES_HOME=/usr/lib/postgresql/8.4
            export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6:$PYTHONPATH
            export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/share/java:/usr/lib/:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/share/java:/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
            export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/bin:$ICE_HOME/bin:$POSTGRES_HOME/bin

    Please note that the precise details of these environment variables can
    change as new versions of software are released. You can retrieve the
    pathname for a file by using the which command. So if you are unsure
    what path to use in your environment variables, e.g. for the ICE\_HOME
    variable you can execute the following command:

    ::

            $ which icegridnode
            /Users/ome/apps/OMERO.libs/bin/icegridnode

    You can now set the ICE\_HOME path to something similar to
    **/Users/ome/apps/OMERO.libs/bin** based upon the output from which,
    e.g.

    ::

            export ICE_HOME=/Users/ome/apps/OMERO.libs/bin/icegridnode

    As a last ditch effort, on a Linux or Mac OS X machine you can use the
    find command to help you discover whereabouts something is located in
    your filesystem. e.g.

    ::

            $ find / -name "icegridnode" 2>/dev/null

    However this might take a long time to run, especially on a big
    filesystem, so you might get a more timely solution by going to the
    OMERO forums.

    If the command gives no output then perhaps Ice is not installed, in
    which case you should see the section above on installing Ice.

    You can also add your OMERO bin directory to your path like so:

    ::

            export PATH=$PATH:path-to-your-omero-install-directory/bin


.. only:: windows

   **Update your Windows environment variables: (REQUIRES RESTART!)**

   #. Locate the *System* control panel page on the Start Menu under
      :menuselection:`Settings --> Control Panel`, open it and navigate to the *Advanced*
      tab (on Windows Vista the dialog will be visible after clicking
      the *Change settings* link on the *System* control panel page):

      .. figure:: /images/installation-images/system-properties.png
         :align: center
         :alt: Advanced System Properties

         Advanced System Properties
   #. Open the *Environment Variables* dialog by clicking on the
      *Environment Variables...* button of the above dialog:

      .. figure:: /images/installation-images/environment-variables.png
         :align: center
         :alt: Environment Variables

         Environment Variables
   #. Edit the existing *System* environment variable ``Path`` and add a
      new variable pointing to the Ice installation 'bin' directory. At
      the front of the ``Path`` variable also add a new string pointing
      to the Python installation directory (e.g. ``C:\Python26``). Then
      add a brand new *System* environment variable called
      ``PYTHONPATH`` pointing to the Ice installation 'python' location:

      .. |PATH variable| image:: /images/installation-images/path-variable.png
         :alt: Path variable

      .. |PATH variable 2| image:: /images/installation-images/path-variable2.png
         :alt: Path variable

      .. |PYTHONPATH variable| image:: /images/installation-images/pythonpath-variable.png
         :alt: PythonPath variable


      |PATH variable| |PATH variable 2| |PYTHONPATH variable|

   #. **Restart your computer**. For environment changes to take
      effect in background services, a restart is unfortunately
      necessary. See `<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/821761>`_
      for more information.


When performing some operations the clients make use of temporary file
storage and log directories. By default these files are stored below the
users HOME directory in ``$HOME/omero/tmp``, ``$HOME/omero/log`` and
``$HOME/omero/sessions`` (resp. ``$HOME\omero\tmp``, ``$HOME\omero\log`` and
``$HOME\omero\sessions``). If your home(\ ``~``) directory ``$HOME`` is
stored on a network, possibly NFS mounted (or similar), then these
temporary files are being written and read over the network. This can
slow access down.

The OMERO.server also access the ``$HOME/omero/tmp`` and
``$HOME/omero/log`` folders of **the user the server process is running
as** (resp. ``$HOME\omero\tmp`` and ``$HOME\omero\log``). 
As the server makes heavier use of these folders than the clients,
if the users home(\ ``~``) is stored on a network the server can be
slowed down. To get round this for the OMERO.server you can define an
``OMERO_TEMPDIR`` environment variable pointing to a temporary directory
located on the local file system e.g. ``/tmp`` (resp. ``C:\tmp\``).


Creating a database as root
---------------------------

Probably the most important step towards having a working server system
is having a properly configured database.

.. only:: unix

    On most systems, a "postgres" user will be created which has admin
    privileges, while the UNIX ``root`` user itself does *not* have admin
    privileges. Therefore it is necessary to either become the ``postgres``
    user or use sudo as below:

    -  Create a non-superuser database user and record the name and
       password. The default name and password for the user are "db\_user"
       and "db\_password" respectively. Note that you should use your own
       choice of username and password here. You will need to configure
       OMERO to use your username and password by setting the omero.db.name
       and omero.db.pass properties (below).

       ::

           # For PostgreSQL 8.4.x and later
           $ sudo -u postgres createuser -P -D -R -S db_user
           Enter password for new role:       # db_password
           Enter it again:       # db_password

    -  Create a database for OMERO to reside in

       ::

           $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O db_user omero_database

    -  Add the PL/pgSQL language to your database

       ::

           $ sudo -u postgres createlang plpgsql omero_database

    -  Check to make sure the database has been created, you have PostgreSQL
       client authentication correctly set up and the database is owned by
       the **db\_user** user.

       ::

           $ psql -h localhost -U db_user -l
           Password for user db_user: 
                   List of databases
              Name         |  Owner   | Encoding  
           ----------------+----------+-----------
            omero_database | db_user  | SQL_ASCII
            postgres       | postgres | SQL_ASCII
            template0      | postgres | SQL_ASCII
            template1      | postgres | SQL_ASCII
           (4 rows)

    If you have problems, especially with the last step, take a look at
    :doc:`server-postgresql` since the authentication mechanism
    is probably not properly configured.

.. only:: windows

    -  Create a non-superuser database user (make sure to note down the name
       and password) using **pgAdmin III**. You can find *pgAdmin III* on
       the Start Menu under :menuselection:`Programs --> PostgreSQL 9.1 --> pgAdmin III`:

       #. Double-click on the *PostgreSQL 9.1* database (or right-click and
          choose *Connect*) and provide your *postgres* user login password
          set during the installation, above.

       #. Create a new role with the *Role name* ``db_user`` and a
          *Password* ``db_password``. Note that these are examples, and you
          should use your own choice of username and password here. You will
          need to configure OMERO to use your username and password by
          setting the omero.db.name and omero.db.pass properties (below).

       .. |newrolename| image:: /images/install-windows-screenshots/pgadmin-05newrole-name.png

             :alt: New database name

             New database name

    -  Confirm PL/pgSQL language support in your newly created database

       #. First, go to :menuselection:`File --> Options` select the *Browser* tab and
          activate the *Languages* option:

          .. |pgadmin-optionsmenu| image:: /images/install-windows-screenshots/pgadmin-09optionsmenu.png

          |pgadmin-optionsmenu| |pgadmin-viewlanguages|

       #. Navigate back to your database, expand the database's tree view
          and finally expand the now available *Languages* item:

       #. If the ``plpgsql`` language is missing, right-click on the
          *Extensions* item and select the *New extension...* option in the
          menu. Finally, add the ``plpgsql`` extension, accepting all
          defaults. This will add both the extension and the language. In
          older PostgreSQL versions without extensions, right-click on the
          *Languages* item and select the *New language...* option in the
          menu. Finally, add the ``plpgsql`` language, accepting all
          defaults.

Location for the your OMERO binary repository
---------------------------------------------

-  Create a directory for the OMERO binary data repository. ``/OMERO`` (resp. ``C:\OMERO``)
   is the default location and should be used unless you explicitly have
   a reason not to and know what you are doing.

-  This is *not* where you want the OMERO application to be installed,
   it is a *separate* directory that OMERO.server will use to store
   binary data:

-  You can read more about the :doc:`OMERO binary repository <server-binary-repository>`.

       $ sudo mkdir /OMERO

-  Change the ownership of the directory. ``/OMERO`` \*\ *must* either
   be owned by the user starting the server (it is currently owned by
   the system root) or that user **must** have permission to write to
   the directory. You can find out your username and edit the correct
   permissions as follows:

   ::

       $ whoami
       ome
       $ sudo chown -R ome /OMERO

    Any configuration settings you would like to change can be changed in the 
    next step.

-   Change any settings that are necessary using ``bin/omero config``
    (resp. ``bin\omero config``),
    including the name and/or password for the 'db\_user' database user
    you chose above or the database name if it is not "omero\_database".

        When using ``C:\`` style file paths it is necessary to "escape" the 
        backslashes. For example:

        ::

            C:\> bin\omero config set omero.data.dir C:\\OMERO

-   Create the OMERO database initialization script. You will be asked
    for the version of the script which you would like to generate, where
    both defaults can be accepted. Finally, you'll be asked to enter and
    confirm password for your newly created OMERO root user (this should
    **not** be the same as your Linux/Mac/Windows root user!)

-   Before starting the OMERO.server we should run the OMERO diagnostics
    script so that we check that all of our settings are correct, e.g.

    .. only:: unix

        ::

            $ bin/omero admin diagnostics

    .. only:: windows

        ::

            C:\omero_dist\> bin\\omero admin diagnostics

-   You can now start the server using:

    .. only:: unix

        ::

             $ bin/omero admin start
             Creating var/master
             Initializing var/log

        If you've chosen a non-default install directory (other than
        ``C:\omero_dist``), the output will look like this:

        ::

            C:\OMERO.server-4.4> bin\omero admin start
            Found default value: C:\omero_dist\var\master

-  If you would like to move the directory again, see
   ``bin\winconfig.bat --help``, which gets called automatically on an
   initial install.

-  You can now test that you can log-in as "root", either with the
   OMERO.insight client or command-line:

    .. only:: unix

        ::

            $ bin/omero login
            Server: [localhost]
            Username: [root]
            Password:         # root_password

    .. only:: windows

        ::

            C:\OMERO.server-4.4> bin\omero login
            Server: [localhost]
            Username: [root]
            Password:         # root_password

OMERO.web and Administration
----------------------------

.. note:: In order to deploy OMERO.web in a production environment such as Apache or IIS please follow the instructions under :ref:`sysadmins/install-web`.

Otherwise please give a try of the internal webserver and setup:

.. only:: unix

	::

	    $ bin/omero config set omero.web.application_server development

.. only:: windows

	::

	    c:\omero_dist> bin\omero config set omero.web.application_server development
	    c:\omero_dist> bin\omero config set omero.web.session_engine "django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache"
	    c:\omero_dist> bin\omero config set omero.web.cache_backend "file://C:/windows/temp/"

then start by

.. only:: unix

	::

	    $ bin/omero web start
	    Starting django development webserver... 
	    Validating models...
	    0 errors found

	    Django version 1.1.1, using settings 'omeroweb.settings'
	    Development server is running at http://0.0.0.0:4080/
	    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
	
.. only:: windows

	::

	    c:\omero_dist> bin\omero web start
	    Starting django development webserver... 
	    Validating models...
	    0 errors found

	    Django version 1.1.1, using settings 'omeroweb.settings'
	    Development server is running at http://0.0.0.0:4080/
	    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

Once you have deployed and started the server you can use your browser
to access the OMERO.web interface:

-  `http://localhost:4080/ <http://localhost:4080/>`_

   .. figure:: /images/installation-images/login.png
      :align: center
      :alt: OMERO.webadmin login

Enabling Movie creation from OMERO.
-----------------------------------

OMERO has the facility to create AVI/MPEG Movies from Images, which can
be called from Insight. The page :ref:`sysadmins/omeromovie` gives details on how to enable them.

Post-installation items
-----------------------

Backup
^^^^^^

One of your first steps after putting your OMERO server into production
should be deciding on when and how you are going to :ref:`backup your
database and binary data <sysadmins/server-backup-and-restore>`. Please do not omit this
step.

Security
^^^^^^^^

It is also now recommended that you read the :ref:`sysadmins/server-security` page
to get a good idea as to what you need to do to get OMERO clients
speaking to your newly installed OMERO.server in accordance with your
institution or company's security policy.

Advanced configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have the base server running, you may want to try enabling some
of the advanced features such as :ref:`sysadmins/server-fs` or :ref:`sysadmins/server-ldap`.
If you have ***Flex data***, you may want to watch :snapshot:`the HCS configuration screencast <movies/omero-4-1/mov/FlexPreview4.1-configuration.mov>`.
See the :plone:`Feature list <products/feature-list>` for more advanced
features you may want to use, and :ref:`sysadmins/server-advanced-configuration` on how to get the most out of
your server.

Update Notification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your OMERO.server installation will check for updates each time it is started from the *Open Microscopy Environment* update server. If you wish to disable this functionality you should do so now as outlined on the :wiki:`UpgradeCheck` page.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My OMERO install doesn't work! What do I do now!?! Examine the :ref:`sysadmins/troubleshooting` page and if all else fails post a
message to our ``ome-users`` mailing list discussed on the OmeroCommunity page.

OMERO Diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want help with your server installation, please include the output of the diagnostics command:

.. literalinclude:: omero-diagnostics
