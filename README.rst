Documentation files to be linked under the ``docs/sphinx`` directory of
http://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy.

***************************
Getting started with Sphinx
***************************

Sphinx depends on the ``sphinx-build`` Python script. As such, it can be
installed on any system with a working Python installation and PIP. On
Windows, make sure that the ``Scripts`` directory under the Python
installation directory (e.g. ``C:\Python26\Scripts``) is configured in your
PATH. On OS X/Linux, ``sphinx-build`` has to be accessible from the command
line.

The Sphinx documentation system can be obtained by issuing::
    
    pip install Sphinx
    
The structure of the documentation folder follows the Sphinx system
guidelines. A quick overview:
 
* source \*.txt files with reST markup live in the root of the folder and
  under subfolders,
* compiled output is placed in ``_build``,
* compiled visual themes are automatically placed in ``_static``,
* Sphinx configuration is held in ``conf.py``,
* goals for ``make`` and ``make.bat`` are held in ``Makefile``.
 
A reference of reStructuredText (reST) is available at
`http://thomas-cokelaer.info <http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_.
It is recommended to familiarise oneself with the syntax outlined there.

A tutorial covering Sphinx, which enhances working with reST documents, can be
found at `http://sphinx.pocoo.org <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/tutorial.html>`_.

Building the documentation
==========================

Basic build commands
--------------------

To clean the build directory of any previous builds, use::
    
    make clean
    
To build the documentation locally in the form of HTML pages, use::
    
    make html
    
To check the links (internal and external) of the documentation, use::
    
    make linkcheck
    
To list all targets of the sphinx builder, use::
    
    make
    
The output should look something like::
    
    Please use `make <target>' where <target> is one of
      html       to make standalone HTML files
      dirhtml    to make HTML files named index.html in directories
      singlehtml to make a single large HTML file
      pickle     to make pickle files
      json       to make JSON files
      htmlhelp   to make HTML files and a HTML help project
      qthelp     to make HTML files and a qthelp project
      devhelp    to make HTML files and a Devhelp project
      epub       to make an epub
      latex      to make LaTeX files, you can set PAPER=a4 or PAPER=letter
      latexpdf   to make LaTeX files and run them through pdflatex
      text       to make text files
      man        to make manual pages
      texinfo    to make Texinfo files
      info       to make Texinfo files and run them through makeinfo
      gettext    to make PO message catalogs
      changes    to make an overview of all changed/added/deprecated items
      linkcheck  to check all external links for integrity
      doctest    to run all doctests embedded in the documentation (if
                 enabled)

OMERO release number
--------------------

The release number of OMERO is set to UNKNOWN by default. There are two ways 
to set this release number.

* Either clone http://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy, initiate the 
  submodules (including this repository) and run at the top-level::

    ./build.py release-docs

  This target will read the latest tag using ``git-describe`` and build the 
  Sphinx documentation using the current OMERO release number.

* Or set the environment variable `OMERO_RELEASE`, e.g.::
    
    OMERO_RELEASE=4.4.4 make clean html
    
****************
Conventions used
****************

Part of the conventions used here is based on work by
`Beno√Æt Bryon <https://github.com/benoitbryon/documentation-style-guide-sphinx>`_.

File names
==========

reST source file names should carry the ``txt`` suffix and use lowercase
alphanumeric characters and the ``-`` (minus) symbol.

Indentation
===========

Most reST directives don't need indentation, unless contents or options have
to be supplied. For consistency, please use 4 space indentation whenever
needed. Do not use indentation for the start of directives (start them at the
edge of the new line). Any content under a reST directive has to be indented
the same way as the options.

Example::
    
    .. toctree::
        :maxdepth: 2
        
        Some content here...
    
Line wrapping
=============

reST source files should use 78 lines for wrapping text. Please consult the
manual of your favourite text editor to see how to switch on text wrapping.

Blank lines
===========

Two new lines should be put before top-lined, top-level section names, i.e.
before H1 and H2. One new line in any other case.

Example::
    
    ###############
    Part title (H1)
    ###############
    
    Introduction text.
    (blank)
    (blank)
    ******************
    Chapter title (H2)
    ******************
    
Title headings
==============

Every reST source file should begin with an H2 (level two) title. H1 titles
are reserved for the index files (``index.txt``).

The following symbols should be used to create headings:
 
* ``#`` with top line for parts
* ``*`` with top line for chapters
* ``=`` for sections
* ``-`` for subsections
* ``^`` for subsubsections
* ``"`` for paragraphs
 
Example::
    
    ###############
    Part title (H1)
    ###############
    
    H1 only in indexes.
    
    
    ******************
    Chapter title (H2)
    ******************
    
    Sample file content.
    
    
    ********************
    Another chapter (H2)
    ********************
    
    Section title (H3)
    ==================
    
    Subsection title (H4)
    ---------------------
    
    Subsubsection title (H5)
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    Paragraph title (H6)
    """"""""""""""""""""
    
    And some text.
    
Page labels and references
==========================

Every page can be uniquely referenced using the sphinx doc directive. Like 
other directives, you can use the absolute file path, i.e. relative to the 
top-level directory:
``:doc: `/path/name-of-the-page``` or ``:doc: `link to my page </path/name-of-the-page>```.

Only when a good reason exists, a document can also start with a label::
    
    .. _page-label:
    
    *****************
    Title of the page
    *****************

Use of labels to refer to whole files is discouraged. References to labels
above tables and images are encouraged. The ``:ref:`` Sphinx role is advised
over standard reST links, as it works across files and reference names are
automatically generated (e.g. from caption of an image).

Images vs. Figures
==================

reST allows for two types of image embedding: using the ``image`` and
``figure`` directive. It is recommended to use the latter, as legends and
captions can be added easier.

All images referenced in a reST document shall be placed in an ``images``
folder in the top-level directory of the documentation.

Please do not use relative (``../../../images/foo.jpg``) paths to refer to
images. Sphinx does a good job at creating paths, so one can use
``/images/foo.jpg``

Tables
======

Please do not use tables for collections of links and figures, and leave them 
solely for use as actual tables. While it can be used in HTML to shoehorn 
content into boxes, it doesn't work too well for other output, e.g. latex.

Substitutions, aliases and hyperlinks
=====================================

reST allows for using substitutions in cases where a piece of markup is used
more than once, e.g.::
    
    Please visit Python.org_
    
    ...
    
    .. _Python.org: http://python.org
    
If a hyperlink appears only once, please use anonymous, "one-off" hyperlinks
(two underscores)::
    
    `RFC 2396 <http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt>`__ and `RFC
    2732 <http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt>`__ together
    define the syntax of URIs.
    
Finally, please avoid using ``here`` as the hyperlink name, as in::
    
    (...) go `here <http://www.google.com>`_.
    
Common markups
==============

* Notes should be formatted using the note directive: ``.. note::``
* Definition lists can be created and cross-referenced using the glossary
  directive: ``.. glossary::``
* References to external documentation can be formatted using:
  ``.. seealso::``
* Menu selections should be marked using the appropriate role:
  ``:menuselection: `Start --> Programs```

Global substitutions
====================

Some substitutions have been implemented using ``rst_epilog`` in ``conf.py``.
They can be used in all pages of the documentation.

======= ============= ===================

Page references
---------------

The table below lists substitutions that can be used to create references to 
sections of the OMERO documentation.

==================  ===========================

==================  ===========================

For the most up-to-date list, please consult ``conf.py`` (section
``rst_epilog``).

Common URLs
===========

Some URLs are widely used across the OME documentation. Using the Sphinx
``extlinks`` extension, a dictionary of aliases to base URLs has been defined
for the following:
 
* Trac tickets: ``:ticket: `3442```, displayed as ``<a>#3442</a>``
* Snapshots: ``:snapshot: `omero/myzip.zip```
* Plone pages: ``:omero_plone: `Downloads <downloads>```
* DOIs: ``:doi: `Dantas, et al., JCB <10.1083/jcb.201012093>```
* Github source code, e.g. ``:source: `etc/omero.properties```
* OME Forums: ``:forum: `viewforum.php?f=3```
* Mailing lists: ``:mailinglist:`ome-users/```

For the most up-to-date list, please consult ``conf.py`` (section
``extlinks``).

Inclusion of content
====================

When a specific type of content (e.g. code snippet) repeats itself among many
pages, it is advised to store it in a seperate file without the default
``.txt`` extension. This file can then be later included using the
``literalinclude`` directive.

*******************
Writing conventions
*******************

* Do not use contractions (can't, isn't, I'll, etc.) in the documentation.
* All headings should begin with a capital letter for the first word and all 
nouns in the title.
* All sub-headings should begin with a capital letter for the first word and 
continue in lowercase, except where they refer to terms which are abbreviated 
in the text e.g. Virtual Machine.
* Use the full product name, e.g. OMERO.insight instead of Insight.
* Avoid using resp. in brackets to refer to alternative file names etc. Just 
use 'or'.
* Use full words rather than symbols in headings if possible, e.g. use 'and' rather than '&'
