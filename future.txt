Future Development
==================

Our goal in 2011 and 2012 has been to deliver a fully functional OMERO
application for use across a broad range of imaging applications,
including multi-dimensional light microscopy, electron microscopy,
high content screening and with our Beta-4.3.x releases, digital
pathology. The 4.4.0 release substantially updates our permissions
system, allowing users to have much better control on how their data
is shared with other users.

We are, in a stepwise fashion, bringing in our :ref:`server/fs` and are
driving the development of :ref:`clients/overview`. This
includes improved support for ImageJ in OMERO.insight, support for
WebStart for OMERO.insight, and a new design for OMERO.web.

In our next releases, we will extend this facility, improving
performance of the server, and fully enabling distribution of processing
tasks. We will also add support for directly viewing user and server
file systems. A few highlights scheduled for the remainder 2012:

- Extension of the functionality for OMERO.fs, to continue to drive
  flexible access to image data.

- Updating of the :plone:`OME data model <support/file-formats>` to
  allow support of :plone:`N-dimensional data
  <support/file-formats/working-with-ome-xml/6d-7d-and-8d-storage>`.

- Improved visualization tools for large images sets (e.g. HCS and
  FLIM)-- heatmaps, etc.

- Improving our documentation, to ensure that sites that develop with
  OMERO have everything they need.

As always, our `roadmaps
<http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/roadmap>`_ are available. We
welcome queries and comments. :plone:`Get involved! <community>`
