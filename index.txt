OMERO |release| Documentation
#############################

This documentation is a work in progress and many aspects of OMERO are
not yet covered.

The OMERO documentation is divided into three parts. The :doc:`users/index` 
covers the basic usage of OMERO as well as training material suitable for most 
end-users. System administrators wanting to install an OMERO server will be 
more interested by the :doc:`sysadmins/index` and subsequent sections. 
Finally, developers can find more specific information about OMERO in the 
:doc:`developers/index`.
