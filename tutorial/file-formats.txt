This page lists all the formats currently supported

Currently Supported Importer Formats
------------------------------------

OMERO uses the `Bio-Formats library
<http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats>`_ to support over 120
different proprietary file formats. Please note however that we try to
extensively test each file format before we add, so our success
depends on how much test data we have.

As always, contributions of sample data will help to ensure that the
OMERO accurately supports a wide range of formats, and any
contributions you may wish to make are always welcome by contacting us
on our `forums
<http://www.openmicroscopy.org/community/viewforum.php?f=4>`_, or our
:mailinglist:`user mailing list
<ome-users/>`.
