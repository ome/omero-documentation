OME-XML and OME-TIFF software tools
===================================

The OME consortium currently provides two major tools capable of working
with OME-XML:

-  The `Bio-Formats <http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats>`_
   library is a full-featured library with many features related to
   OME-XML, including conversion of third party file format metadata
   into OME-XML structures. It can write image data to the OME-TIFF
   format.
-  The `OMERO server </site/support/omero4>`_ works directly with
   OME-XML. It can import data from OME-XML and OME-TIFF, as well as
   export to OME-TIFF.

In addition to the above packages, this page outlines several useful
tools, some of which we have developed ourselves, for working with
documents in the OME-XML and OME-TIFF formats.

Extracting the OME-XML from an OME-TIFF file
--------------------------------------------

If you install the :bf_doc:`Bio-Formats command line
tools <users/comlinetools/index>`, you can
produce a nicely formatted OME-XML string from an OME-TIFF file with:

::

    tiffcomment file.ome.tif | xmlindent

Alternately, if you have ImageMagick installed, one easy way to extract
the OME-XML embedded in the TIFF headers is to use it from the command
line:

::

    identify -verbose

If you are working in C/C++, we recommend the open source
`LibTIFF <http://www.libtiff.org/>`_ library, or Bio-Formats via the
:bf_doc:`Bio-Formats C++ bindings <developers/c-bindings>`.

If you are looking for a solution in Java, there are several options.
Bio-Formats can read OME-TIFF files, as well as convert from many
third-party formats into OME-TIFF format—see the :doc:`example source code
page <ome-tiff-code>` for specific examples. Alternately, the open
source `ImageJ <http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/>`_ application reads
multi-page TIFF files, storing the TIFF comment into the associated
FileInfo object's "description" field.

Processing an OME-XML block
---------------------------

If the XML was stored without line breaks, it can still be difficult to
read after being extracted. There are several solutions to this problem,
such as using an XML viewer or editor (web browsers work well), or
processing the XML with a SAX or DOM library.

On most Linux distributions, you can install the libxml package and use
the xmllint program:

::

    xmllint --format file.xml

Here is a Perl script that uses
`XML::LibXML <http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/11/14/xml-libxml.html>`_ to
"pretty print" an XML document with appropriate whitespace:

::

    formatxml.pl

    use XML::LibXML;
    $file = $ARGV[0];
    $parser = XML::LibXML->new(); die "Cannot create XML parser" unless defined $parser;
    $parser->validation(0);
    if (defined $file) { $doc = $parser->parse_file($file); }
    else { $doc = $parser->parse_fh(STDIN); } print $doc->toString(1);

Unfortunately, both xmllint and the above Perl script can be somewhat
fragile; if there are any errors or abnormalities in the XML, they
generally fail to produce any indentation. Thus, we have also written
some Java code to do the same thing; just download the 
:bf_doc:`Bio-Formats command line tools <users/comlinetools/index>` and run:

::

    xmlindent file.xml

Another option is to feed the XML into our 
:doc:`OME-XML Java library </ome-xml-java-library>`, which provides methods 
for querying and manipulating the OME-XML (using DOM and SAX). This library is 
what Bio-Formats uses to work with OME-XML.

Validating OME-XML
------------------

We have created a command line tool in Java for validating OME-XML, and
included it as part of the :bf_doc:`Bio-Formats command line
tools <users/comlinetools/index>`. The command is:

::

    xmlvalid file.xml

Also available is a web-based `OME-XML
validator <http://validator.openmicroscopy.org.uk/>`_ for checking files
in OME-XML or OME-TIFF formats, including:

-  Conformance to the OME-XML schema
-  Listing missing internal references
-  Listing external references
-  Correct TiffData block usage
-  Frame counts in TIFF files

Alternately, you can use the more general online `W3C XML
validator <http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv>`_ to validate your
OME-XML blocks. For best results, be sure to check the "keep going"
option.

Another option is to use a commercial XML application such as Turbo XML
to work with and validate your OME-XML documents.
