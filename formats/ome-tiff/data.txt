OME-TIFF Sample Data
====================


This section provides some sample data in OME-TIFF format, as well as an
analysis of several file formats and compression techniques. There are
also some artificial sample datasets (i.e. not produced from an
acquisition system) designed for developer testing that illustrate some
possible data organizations, which should be useful if you are
interested in implementing support for OME-TIFF within your software.

Artificial datasets
-------------------

All datasets in the following table were :source:`artificially
generated <components/scifio/src/loci/formats/tools/MakeTestOmeTiff.java>`
with each plane labeled according to its dimensional position for easy
testing. Each one consists of a single OME-TIFF file (2012-06 schema
version) containing every constituent image plane. For an example of an
OME-TIFF dataset distributed across multiple TIFF files, see the
``tubhiswt`` biological example in the next section.

A sample biological dataset
---------------------------

The following OME-TIFF datasets consist of tubulin histone GFP
coexpressing *C. elegans* embryos. Many thanks to `Josh
Bembenek <http://loci.wisc.edu/people/josh-bembenek>`_ for preparing
and imaging this sample data.

The datasets were acquired on a multiphoton workstation (2.1 GHz Athlon
XP 3200+ with 1GB of RAM) using
`WiscScan <http://loci.wisc.edu/software/wiscscan>`_. All image
planes were collected at 512x512 resolution in 8-bit grayscale, with an
integration value of 2. The table below also lists the space
requirements for each dataset with various formats and compression
types.

.. note::

    The files available for download have been updated to the 2008-02
    schema version since their initial creation. The figures regarding
    various storage formats were computed before this update; thus, the
    byte counts between the downloadable ZIP files and the "zipped
    OME-TIFF" entry do not precisely match.

Efficiency of planar access
---------------------------

The following table compiles our results with average plane size
computed from the numbers above, and briefly summarizes each format's
ability to efficiently access individual image planes. We have not
performed benchmarks involving individual planar access for each
formatâ€”mostly because for many of these formats (especially zip, gzip
and 7-zip) it is quite impractical to attempt efficient access to
individual planes.

The performance penalty for accessing individual image planes from
externally compressed formats (zip, gzip, and 7-zip) is high, since the
data must be decompressed. There is little penalty for accessing them
from uncompressed OME-XML or OME-TIFFâ€”with OME-XML, file readers can
build a list of offsets by skipping past the bulk of the BinData
characters according to the Length attribute values, and with OME-TIFF,
file readers can seek to the offsets indicated in the IFD entries.

Accessing them from an uncompressed OME-TIFF file, however, is
efficient. In addition, the TIFF format maintains compatibility with the
multitude of existing software that works with single- and multi-page
TIFF files.

Space required on disk
----------------------

As shown in the table above, and the chart :ref:`figure-tiff-chart`, our 
figures indicate that the most efficient format for space is OME-TIFF 
compressed with the
`7-zip <http://www.7-zip.org/>`_ utility. Also good are gzipped OME-XML
(omez) and zipped OME-TIFF.

   OME-TIFF space used

Uncompressed OME-TIFF format, while the least space-efficient, provides
its own advantages: it is highly compatible and provides efficient
access to individual image planes.

OME-TIFF with LZW often performs nearly as well as the externally
compressed formats (zip, gzip and 7-zip), without the performance
penalty of searching through a compressed archive. However, LZW is
noticeably less efficient to decode than uncompressed TIFF is, and LZW
is an additional requirement for client softwareâ€”it may be that some
software supports uncompressed multi-page TIFF, but not LZW. Even more
unfortunate, the 7-zip algorithm appears to perform less well on
LZW-compressed OME-TIFFs than on uncompressed OME-TIFFs.

Lastly, we saw no advantage to zipping or 7-zipping OME-XML. If you want
to distribute an OME-XML file, we recommend gzipped OME-XML (omez)
format, as it is the OME standard.

Recommendations
---------------

In conclusion, we highlight the following formats as most useful,
depending on your circumstances:

-  **Zipped OME-TIFF** â€“ cuts down on file size while retaining the
   underlying compatibility of OME-TIFF. Use zipped OME-TIFF for wide
   distribution of data to colleagues. Zip is a ubiquitous compression
   format, decodable on all major operating systems. The downside is
   that it typically does not compress as well as 7-zip does.
-  **7-zipped OME-TIFF** â€“ minimizes file size. As the most
   space-efficient format, use 7-zipped OME-TIFF for archival purposes,
   for transport from one OME database to another, and possibly for
   online distribution if space is a major concern and your target
   audience is computer-savvy enough to install 7-zip. The only
   downsides are that 7-zip is less ubiquitous than zip, and compressing
   a dataset with 7-zip takes longer than doing so with zip.
-  **OME-TIFF with LZW** â€“ provides space advantages nearly as good as
   the externally compressed formats (zip, gzip, 7-zip) without
   sacrificing the accessibility of TIFF, for the most part. The
   downsides are that LZW takes somewhat longer to process than
   uncompressed TIFF, some software does not support LZW compression,
   and OME-TIFF with LZW does not shrink as much as uncompressed
   OME-TIFF does with external compression techniques.
-  **OME-TIFF** â€“ maximizes compatibility. When actively working with
   data, storing it in uncompressed OME-TIFF format provides many
   options for efficient analysis and visualization. The downside is
   that the data takes up more space on disk.
-  **OME-XML** â€“ provides metadata in a directly human-readable form. In
   addition, OME-XML maximizes compatibility with XML software. The
   downside is that very few image software packages support OME-XML.
