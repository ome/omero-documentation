OME-TIFF Overview
=================

Terminology
-----------

- **Image:** a single (2D) image plane
- **Dataset:** a collection of image planes composing a multidimensional
  structure (also called a multidimensional image or OME image)
- **OME dataset:** a collection of related OME images
- **OME project:** a collection of related OME datasets
- **Pixels:** image samples acquired from a microscope or other source
- **Metadata:** auxiliary information associated with the pixels, such as
  who acquired the data, when it was acquired, conditions of the
  experiment, etc.
- **Multi-page TIFF:** a TIFF file containing multiple image planes
- **OME-XML metadata:** a block of OME-XML representing image metadata
  (but not pixels)

Rationale
---------

The Open Microscopy Environment Consortium has defined a file format
called OME-XML for biological image data including a rich set of
microscopy-specific metadata. OME-XML's major strength lies in its
extensible, human-readable XML schemas for image metadata.
Unfortunately, OME-XML has some of drawbacks:

#. Decoding base64-encoded image planes is computationally expensive.
#. There is no facility to split a dataset among multiple files on disk.
#. Far fewer applications support OME-XML than TIFF.

To address these concerns, we have created the OME-TIFF Format to
maximize the respective strengths of OME-XML and TIFF, taking advantage
of the rich metadata defined in OME-XML while retaining the pixels in
multi-page TIFF format for greater compatibility.

Characteristics
---------------

An OME-TIFF dataset has the following characteristics:

#. Image planes are stored within one multi-page TIFF file, or across
   multiple TIFF files. Any image organization is feasible.
#. A complete OME-XML metadata block describing the dataset is embedded
   in each TIFF file's header. Thus, even if some of the TIFF files in a
   dataset are misplaced, the metadata remains intact.
#. The OME-XML metadata block may contain
   anything a standard OME-XML file can, including multiple OME images
   with multiple sets of pixels.
#. OME-TIFF uses the standard TIFF mechanism for storing one or more image 
   planes in each of the constituent files, instead of encoding pixels as 
   base64 chunks within the XML. Since TIFF is an image
   format, it makes sense to only use OME-TIFF as opposed to OME-XML, when 
   there is at least one image plane.

    :doc:`specification`.

    There is further information about :doc:`tools` available.

    We also have some :doc:`code` in Java for
    reading and writing OME-TIFF.

    Lastly, some :doc:`data` is available for
    download, along with statistics comparing OME-TIFF and OME-XML with
    various types of compression.
