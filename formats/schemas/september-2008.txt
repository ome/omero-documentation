Changes For September 2008
==========================


List of the key changes for the September 2008 major release of the
ome-xml data model.

The new major release of the schema has a new namespace and all version
numbers are reset to 1. As a major release, any file that validated
correctly using the last major release will probably not validate
correctly using this new release. Some files that failed to validate
before will now be valid. It is important to update any file readers and
writers to understand the changes.

The version number of all schema files is now 1.


This schema uses the new namespace:

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/[NameSpaceTitle]/2008-09/

For the OME schema

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2008-09/

and that the schema file will be located at

Overview of Changes
-------------------

Additional Schema file SA.xsd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This provides support for the new StructuredAnnotation objects. The list
of annotations is:

::

    XmlAnnotation
    FileAnnotation
    ListAnnotation
    LongAnnotation
    DoubleAnnotation
    StringAnnotation
    BooleanAnnotation
    TimestampAnnotation

Additional Schema file OMERO.xsd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This provides support for the specific use of OMERO in the
StructuredAnnotation objects. Each OMERO specific block is stored in an
XmlAnnotation. It is not strictly part of the model as it provides
support only to the OMERO system. The schema will be published to show
how we are using structured annotations within OMERO.


Optional and non-optional Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The following objects have been made **optional** to allow the import
   of the metadata from Bio-Formats and maintain consistency:

::

    OME:Image:CreationDate
    OME:Image:Pixels:Plane:PlaneTiming:DeltaT
    OME:Image:Pixels:Plane:PlaneTiming:ExposureTime
    OME:Experiment:ExperimenterRef
    OME:Instrument:Microscope
    OME:Instrument:Objective:CalibratedMagnification
    OME:Instrument:Objective:LensNA
    OME:Instrument:Objective:NominalMagnification
    OME:Instrument:Objective:WorkingDistance
    OME:Instrument:Filter:TransmittanceRange
    OME:Instrument:Filter:TransmittanceRange:CutIn
    OME:Instrument:Filter:TransmittanceRange:CutOut
    OME:Instrument:Filter:TransmittanceRange:Transmittance
    OME:StagePosition:PositionX
    OME:StagePosition:PositionY
    OME:StagePosition:PositionZ
    OME:Project:ExperimenterRef
    ManufactSpec:Manufacturer
    ManufactSpec:Model

ManufactSpec is the base type for several other objects.

-  The following objects have been made **optional in the model** but
   **NOT in the OMERO database** - a value will be generated on import:

::

    OME:Image:Name
    OME:Plate:Name
    OME:Dataset:Name
    OME:Project:Name
    OME:Screen:Name

-  The following objects **are not optional** - but they now
   support the value Unknown:

::

    OME:Instrument:LightSource:Laser:LaserMedium - Added new UnknownLaserMedia type to union.
    OME:Instrument:LightSource:Laser:Type - added Unknown.
    OME:Instrument:LightSource:Arc:Type - added Unknown.
    OME:Instrument:LightSource:Filament:Type - added Unknown.
    OME:Instrument:Microscope:Type - added Unknown.
    OME:Instrument:Objective:Correction - added Unknown.
    OME:Instrument:Objective:Immersion - added Unknown.
    OME:Instrument:Detector:Type - added Unknown.


MicrobeamManipulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Move MicrobeamManipulation from Image to Experiment 
   **(held until next release)**

At present MicrobeamManipulation is stored directly under an Image with
a link to an Experiment. The structure this produces is too flexible and
allow loops of references to be created. It is proposed that we move all
the MicrobeamManipulation objects to be located under the Experiment and
replace them in each Image with zero or more MicrobeamManipulationRef
objects. This also allows one MicrobeamManipulation operation to be used
in more than one Image.

-  Rework ROI in MicrobeamManipulation **(held until next release)**

As a separate issue to above the ROI used by the MicrobeamManipulation
should stop being a Ref to one stored in Image. In the current situation
the manipulated ROI is listed along with all the other ROIs. It is not
the same as the other ROIs could legitimately be adjusted by the user.
The MicrobeamManipulation ROI is however fixed and should not be changed
after the manipulation. This change is being made at this time as the
ROI is already being changed.

New ROI model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new model has more powerful ROI model and the display options are
now stored as Structured Annotations. Elements added include
LogicalChannelRef, ShapeID, ROI, Shape, BasicSvgShape and several shapes
derived from BasicSvgShape.

Min/Max/Optional/Required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All elements now have an explicit minOccurs and maxOccours. All
attributes now have a use value "optional" or "required".

PinholeSize type changed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PinholeSize type has changed from xsd:positiveInteger to xsd:float
with units um.

Added LightEmittingDiode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This element is a stub to act as a placeholder until more values are
needed for this type.

Pixels
^^^^^^

Pixels can now contain **EITHER** BinData or TiffData - previously the model 
allowed there to be a mixture of the two, which was not the intended use.
