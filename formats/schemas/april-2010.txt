Changes For April 2010
======================


List of key changes for April 2010 major release of the ome-xml data
model.

The new major release of the schema has a new namespace and all version
numbers are reset to 1. As a major release, any file that validated
correctly using the last major release will probably not validate
correctly using this new release. Some files that failed to validate
before will now be valid. It is important to update any file readers and
writers to understand the changes.


The version number of all schema files is now 1.

This schema uses the new namespace
