Changes For June 2013
=====================


The list of the key changes for the June 2013 major release of the
ome-xml data model. This schema release will tie in with the Bio-Formats
5.0 release.

The new major release of the schema has a new namespace and all version
numbers are reset to 1. As a major release, any file that validated
correctly using the last major release will probably not validate
correctly using this new release. Some files that failed to validate
before will now be valid. It is important to update any file readers and
writers to understand the changes.

The version number of all schema files is now 1.

This schema uses the new namespace:

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/[NameSpaceTitle]/2013-06/

For the OME schema

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2013-06/

and that the schema file will be located at
