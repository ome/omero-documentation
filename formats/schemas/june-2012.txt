Changes For June 2012
=====================


The list of the key changes for the June 2012 major release of the
ome-xml data model. This schema release will tie in with the Bio-Formats
4.4 release.

The new major release of the schema has a new namespace and all version
numbers are reset to 1. As a major release, any file that validated
correctly using the last major release will probably not validate
correctly using this new release. Some files that failed to validate
before will now be valid. It is important to update any file readers and
writers to understand the changes.

The version number of all schema files is now 1.

This schema uses the new namespace:

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/[NameSpaceTitle]/2012-06/

For the OME schema

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2012-06/

and that the schema file will be located at

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2012-06/ome.xsd

Overview of changes
-------------------

-  Release in step with release of Bio-Formats 4.4
-  Preparation for the Major release of OMERO **after** 4.4
-  Work to allow full code generation of OME Model API direct from the
   XSD files
-  Almost full synchronisation of the OME Model with the OMERO Database
   structure
-  The direction of references between Screen, Plate and Well, and between
   Project, Dataset and Image, have been reversed
-  A major reworking of ROI
-  ``Pixels`` is **DEPRECATED**, but it is still required at present
-  ``OTF`` and all associated objects ***REMOVED***

General changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Ensure **all** colours are stored as new type ``Color``
-  The default value for all colours is now solid white (due to legacy
   colour default it was totally transparent red)
-  Add ``appinfo`` blocks for ``xsd-fu`` to specify plurals
-  Add ``appinfo`` blocks for ``xsd-fu`` to specify abstract objects

BinaryFile
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Only the general change adding ``appinfo`` blocks for ``xsd-fu`` to
   specify plurals

OME
^^^

-  Rename ``AcquiredDate`` to ``AcquisitionDate`` in ``Image``
-  Rename ``ExperimentGroup`` to ``Group``
-  Make ``Group`` annotatable
-  Allow multiple ``Leader`` for each ``Group``
-  Remove ``Contact`` for ``Group`` - the transform will convert any
   existing ``Contact`` to a ``Leader``
-  The direction of the references between ``Project``, ``Dataset`` and
   ``Image`` have been reversed for consistency with other linked
   objects
-  Remove ``DisplayName`` from ``Experimenter``
-  The ``ImageRef`` element has been moved from the ``SPW.xsd`` to the
   ``ome.xsd`` schema file
-  ``Pixels`` is **DEPRECATED**, but is still required (the contents of Pixels 
   will be moved up to Image in the
   next release - it is a legacy of when an Image could have multiple
   Pixels sets and has been redundant since the 2009-09 schema fixed the
   number of Pixels sets in an Image at 1)
-  ``OTF`` and all associated objects ***REMOVED***

OMERO
^^^^^

``OMERO.xsd`` is not included in this release. It has been extensively
reworked and expanded as part of the OME Model and OMERO Database
synchronisation but work on this will continue until the release of the
associated OMERO version. The OME Model (i.e. the other XSD files) have
been completely updated for this work. They do not make use of OMERO.xsd
so will be unaffected by the future release of this single file.

.. note::    
    Some differences must remain between OME Model and OMERO Database
    for database optimization reasons - these are handled by special
    cases in our code generation application ``xsd-fu``.

ROI
^^^

-  All objects defining colours now use the type ``OME:Color`` from
   ``ome.xsd``
-  Move ``MarkerStart`` & ``MarkerEnd`` down from ``Shape`` into
   ``Line``, ``Polyline``
-  Add "Polygon" element (a new type of ``Shape``)
-  Delete "Closed" from Polyline (transform a Closed Polyline into a
   Polygon)
-  Delete attribute ``Name`` from ``Shape``
-  Delete ``Description`` from ``Shape``
-  Add ``Visible`` to ``Shape``
-  Add ``Locked`` to ``Shape``
-  Rename ``Fill`` attribute in ``Shape`` to ``FillColor``
-  Rename ``Stroke`` attribute in ``Shape`` to ``StrokeColor``
-  Delete ``Value`` from ``Text``
-  Rename ``Text`` element to ``Label``
-  Rename ``Label`` attribute in ``Shape`` to ``Text``
-  Convert ``Transform`` to new type ``AffineTransform``

SA
^^

Add additional intermediate abstract annotations (``BasicAnnotation``,
``NumericAnnotation``, ``TextAnnotation``, ``TypeAnnotation``) to match
OMERO annotation structure. The current annotations have been modified to
now extend these. This allows the code generation to group annotations
together by intermediate annotation type. The behaviour of the current
annotations has not changed, and the new intermediate abstract
annotations are not used directly.

SPW
^^^

-  Add "FieldIndex" to "Plate" - this means the index of the WellSample
   displays as the default Field
-  The human readable identifier for the screening status has been
   renamed from "Status" to "Type"
-  The direction of the references between Screen and Plate has been
   reversed for consistency with other linked objects.
-  The ImageRef element has been moved to the ``ome.xsd`` schema file
