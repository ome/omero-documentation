Changes For February 2008
=========================




List of the key changes made for the February 2008 major release of the
ome-xml data model.

The new major release of the schema has a new namespace and all version
numbers are reset to 1. As a major release, any file that validated
correctly using the last major release will probably not validate
correctly using this new release. Some files that failed to validate
before will now be valid. It is important to update any file readers and
writers to understand the changes.

Version
~~~~~~~

-  The version number of all schema files is now 1

Namespace
~~~~~~~~~

This schema uses the new namespace

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/[NameSpaceTitle]/2008-02/

For the OME schema

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2008-02/

and that the schema file will be located at

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2008-02/ome.xsd

Description (ome.xsd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Description element has become a string type. Description is not the
correct place for an XML sub-document. It has also an optional reference
to XML:lang that allows the language the Description is written in to be
recorded.

Description (!AnalysisModule.xsd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description has been removed for AnalysisModule. It is now using the
version defined in ome.xsd

UniversallyUniqueIdentifier for files (ome.xsd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add support for splitting data across multiple OME-TIFF files in a
way that will survive file renaming, each file now has a unique
identifier. This is as a UUID attribute on the OME node. It is normally
optional but required if you wish to use multi-part files.

Multi-part OME-TIFF file support (ome.xsd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A TiffData block can now contain a UUID element that specifies the file
to look in for the tiff image data. The UUID element also has an
optional attribute FileName to point to the name for the file containing
the correct data. The UUID is required and the FileName is strongly
recommended. A reader should first open the file pointed to by FileName.
If it does not contain the correct UUID then the reader can either fail
or search the current folder for a file that does contain the correct
UUID. This allows multi-part files to survive renaming.

Removal of Power attributes from Arc and Filament (ome.xsd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the moving of Power into LightSource in the 2007-06 V1 release the
attribute Power was no longer needed in element Arc and Filament. These
Power attributes should have been removed at the time. Any data can be
moved to the Power in LightSource.

Simplifications to the schema (ome.xsd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The types Correction and Immersion have been bundled into elements of
the same name. They were only used once in the schema. This should not
affect instance documents, only any schema derived from ome.xsd.

Clarification of PixelTypes (ome.xsd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The type PixelTypes has been split into two. It now has PixelTypes and
ExtendedPixelTypes. It was being used in two different ways in previous
schemas, once in Pixels and once in OTF. Now Pixels uses PixelTypes and
OTF uses ExtendedPixelTypes.

Element AcquiredPixelsRef has become attribute AcquiredPixels (ome.xsd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This has been changed to make AcquiredPixels consistant with the
DefaultPixels attribute in the Image element. Now both are a PixelsID.

Hash of Plane data (ome.xsd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is now the option to store a SHA1 hash of a plane's image data.
This can be used to detect modification. It is stored as a HashSHA1
element inside each Plane. At present this is the only support hashing
method. Others may be added in future releases.

No significant changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following files have no significant changes from the last version
released:

-  AnalysisChain.xsd
-  BinaryFile.xsd
-  CA.xsd
-  CLI.xsd
-  DataHistory.xsd
-  MLI.xsd
-  SPW.xsd
-  STD.xsd

    Note: the file SPW.xsd has had an import of AnalysisModule.xsd
    removed. This import was spurious as it was not used in this file.
