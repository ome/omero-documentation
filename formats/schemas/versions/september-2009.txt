Changes For September 2009
==========================




The list of the key changes for the September 2009 major release of the
ome-xml data model.

The new major release of the schema has a new namespace and all version
numbers are reset to 1. As a major release, any file that validated
correctly using the last major release will probably not validate
correctly using this new release. Some files that failed to validate
before will now be valid. It is important to update any file readers and
writers to understand the changes.

Version
~~~~~~~

-  The version number of all schema files is now 1.

Namespace
~~~~~~~~~

This schema uses the new namespace

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/[NameSpaceTitle]/2009-09/

For the OME schema

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2009-09/

and that the schema file will be located at

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2009-09/ome.xsd

Overview of Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Full auto-generated documentation for the schema is available at
   `OME-2009-09 </Schemas/Documentation/Generated/OME-2009-09/ome.html>`_

-  There will be an additional Schema file ROI.xsd

This provides support for the new version of the ROI objects. These were
moved from the OME namespace to there own namespace and the objects
updated to be simpler and more consistent. Existing ROI's can be updated
to the new structure.

-  Some support for ROIs in OMERO.xsd has moved to be part of the full
   schema in ROI.xsd

-  Move MicrobeamManipulation from Image to Experiment.

At present MicrobeamManipulation is stored directly under an Image with
a link to an Experiment. The structure this produces is too flexible and
allow loops of references to be created. It is proposed that we move all
the MicrobeamManipulation objects to be located under the Experiment and
replace them in each Image with zero or more MicrobeamManipulationRef
objects. This also allows one MicrobeamManipulation operation to be used
in more than one Image.

-  Rework ROI in MicrobeamManipulation and in Image with its movement to
   the top level OME element.

As a separate issue to above the ROIs used by the MicrobeamManipulation
as a Ref and stored in Image have been moved to the top level. This
allows reuse of the ROI in more than one Image.

-  Merging of LogicalChannel and ChannelComponent into the new Channel.

-  Additional keys and indexes to enforce valid IDs and References,
   listed in the OME:OME element.

-  Support for the AnalysisModuleLibrary used by the original OME server
   has been removed.

-  Support for the DisplayOptions used by the original OME server has
   been removed.

-  Support for the Region used by the original OME server has been
   removed.

-  All description elements and attributes have become simple
   description elements based on xsd::string that preserve white space.

-  The direction of all annotation links have been reversed. Now objects
   in the model link to annotations, not the other way around.

-  Where possible values that are singular are now an attribute of an
   element and values that can be multiple are child elements of an
   element.

-  Units are now specified in the schema annotations.

-  Pixels now link to Channel.

-  It is now possible to define valid MetadataOnly files.

-  There is a large number of general changes and updates as part of a
   major clean up of the types and names used in the schema to
   facilitate code generation direct from the schema.
