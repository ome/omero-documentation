Changes For September 2009
==========================


The list of the key changes for the September 2009 major release of the
ome-xml data model.

The new major release of the schema has a new namespace and all version
numbers are reset to 1. As a major release, any file that validated
correctly using the last major release will probably not validate
correctly using this new release. Some files that failed to validate
before will now be valid. It is important to update any file readers and
writers to understand the changes.

The version number of all schema files is now 1.


This schema uses the new namespace:

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/[NameSpaceTitle]/2009-09/

For the OME schema

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2009-09/

and that the schema file will be located at

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2009-09/ome.xsd

Overview of changes
-------------------

-  Full auto-generated documentation for the schema is available at
   :schema_plone:`OME-2009-09 <Documentation/Generated/OME-2009-09/ome.html>`

Additional Schema file ROI.xsd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This provides support for the new version of the ROI objects. These were
moved from the OME namespace to there own namespace and the objects
updated to be simpler and more consistent. Existing ROI's can be updated
to the new structure.

-  Some support for ROIs in :file:`OMERO.xsd` has moved to be part of the full
   schema in :file:`ROI.xsd`.

MicrobeamManipulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  ``MicrobeamManipulation`` has been moved from ``Image`` to ``Experiment``.

At present ``MicrobeamManipulation`` is stored directly under an ``Image`` 
with a link to an ``Experiment``. The structure this produces is too flexible 
and allow loops of references to be created. It is proposed that we move all
the ``MicrobeamManipulation`` objects to be located under ``Experiment`` and
replace them in each ``Image`` with zero or more ``MicrobeamManipulationRef``
objects. This also allows one ``MicrobeamManipulation`` operation to be used
in more than one ``Image``.

ROI in MicrobeamManipulation and Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  ``ROI`` in ``MicrobeamManipulation`` and in ``Image`` has been reworked 
   inline with its movement to the top level ``OME`` element.

The ROIs used by the ``MicrobeamManipulation``
as a 'Ref' and stored in ``Image`` have been moved to the top level. This
allows reuse of the ROI in more than one ``Image``.

Other changes
-------------

-  ``LogicalChannel`` and ``ChannelComponent`` have been merged into the new 
   ``Channel``.

-  Additional keys and indexes to enforce valid IDs and References,
   are listed in the OME:OME element.

-  Support for the ``AnalysisModuleLibrary`` used by the original OME server
   has been removed.

-  Support for the ``DisplayOptions`` used by the original OME server has
   been removed.

-  Support for the ``Region`` used by the original OME server has been
   removed.

-  All description elements and attributes have become simple
   description elements based on 'xsd::string' that preserve white space.

-  The direction of all annotation links has been reversed. Now objects
   in the model link to annotations, not the other way around.

-  Where possible values that are singular are now an attribute of an
   element, and values that can be multiple are child elements of an
   element.

-  Units are now specified in the schema annotations.

-  ``Pixels`` now link to ``Channel``.

-  It is now possible to define valid Metadata-Only files.

-  There are a large number of general changes and updates as part of a
   major clean up of the types and names used in the schema, to
   facilitate code generation direct from the schema.
