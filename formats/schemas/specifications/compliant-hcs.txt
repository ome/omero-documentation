Compliant HCS Specification
===========================


OME Compliant HCS File Specification. This was developed in conjunction
with the June 2010 release of the OME-XML Model and has been updated to the 
June 2012 release.

A compliant specification for HCS OME files has been defined. This is
not the minimum required for the display of an image, that is the
:doc:`Minimum Specification <minimum>`. This is the
information we feel a file should contain to provide a useful file
conforming to the spirit of the OME projects aims.

This sample structure is based on Sample One in the 
OME Compliant File Specification 
(see :doc:`compliant-file`):

    The data in this sample is nonsense.

Alternative valid forms:

-  Would have a ``ome:TiffData`` block instead of the ``bf:BinData`` block. 
   This would be used in the header of an OME-TIFF file.
-  Would have a ``ome:MetadataOnly`` block instead of the ``bf:BinData`` 
   block. This would **ONLY** be acceptable if the image data of the file
   **CANNOT** be represented in an OME file for technical reasons.
