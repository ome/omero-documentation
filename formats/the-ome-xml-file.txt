The OME-XML Format
==================

OME-XML is a project to provide support for the exchange of microscope
imaging data within the field of life sciences. Its key aspects include
support for collaborative sharing of data between labs who may be using
different apparatus, and the safeguarding of crucial metadata associated
with image files, that can be lost when they are moved across systems (or
in many cases, never recorded at all).

The term "OME-XML" applies to two interrelated but distinct things:

#. A `data model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model>`_ for
   representing microscopy metadata, for use with microscopy file
   formats, expressed as an `XML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>`_
   schema.
#. A `file format <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format>`_ for
   storing microscopy information (both pixels and metadata) using the
   OME-XML data model.

The purpose of OME-XML is to provide a rich, extensible way to save
information concerning microscopy experiments and the images acquired
therein, including:

-  Dimensional parameters defining the scope of the image pixels
   (resolution, number of focal planes, number of time points, number of
   channels etc.).
-  The hardware configuration used to acquire the image planes
   (microscope, detectors, lenses, filters etc.).
-  The settings used with said hardware (physical size of the image
   planes in microns, laser gain and offset, channel configuration
   etc.).
-  The person performing the experiment.
-  Some details on the experiment itself, such as a description, what
   type of experiment (FRET, time lapse, fluorescence lifetime etc.)
   and events occurring during the acquisition (laser ablation, stage
   motion etc.).
-  Additional custom information you may wish to provide about your
   experiment in a structured form (known as 
   :doc:`working-with-ome-xml/structured-annotations`).


Features and applications of the OME-XML file format
----------------------------------------------------

The OME-XML file serves as a convenient file format for data migration
from one site or user to another. The OME-XML file captures all image
acquisition and experimental metadata, along with the binary image data,
and packages it into an easily readable package. Our
`paper <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_ describing the design
and implementation of the OME-XML file appeared in Genome Biology.

.. note::

    OME-XML files can be read by potentially any software package - you
    do not need OME image management software to use OME-XML.

Some specific features of the OME-XML file format:

-  OME-XML files may contain one or more sets of 5-D pixels, for example
   raw data from a microscope, the deconvolved data, and a volume
   rendered view.
-  OME-XML files contain all the metadata associated with an image,
   including the experimental (cells, genes etc.) and acquisition
   (microscope light sources, fluors, filters, detectors etc.)
   metadata.
-  OME-XML Image pixels may be stored compressed (or not) directly in
   XML with base64 encoding. Compression of the pixels and the metadata
   is supported through widely-available patent-free compression schemes
   (gzip and bzip2). OME-XML Images are addressable by plane.
-  OME-XML files have a built-in mechanism for supporting arbitrary
   user-defined data that can be used globally or attached to Images,
   Features (objects inside Images), and Datasets. Mechanisms for
   OME-compliant systems to populate databases with these user-defined
   fields is part of the specification. See the Semantic Type
   Definitions XML Schema, documentation and an example document that
   defines the core OME Semantic Types.

The OME-XML Schema and use are documented
`here <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/>`_.


Migrating or sharing data with OME-XML
--------------------------------------

Data saved in an OME-XML file is easily read by any software capable of
reading and interpreting OME-XML. OME software tools can export and
import OME-XML files, but any OME-XML-aware software can be used.

In the figure below, microscope image data is imported into My OME
Database (more accurately, an instance of OME managing image data at one
location). After a set of analyses is performed, this data is exported
in its entirety (i.e. including binary image data, image metadata, and
the associated analytic results) and then passed to a collaborator's OME
database ("Your OME Database"). This strategy packages analytic data
together with the image data to ensure none of the critical
interpretative information is lost.

Ongoing Development
-------------------

The ongoing development of the OME-XML data model can be tracked on
`http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/>`_.

Users can also add work tickets to the system detailing any changes they
feel should be made.

Commercial Support for OME-XML
------------------------------

Bitplane AG and EAMNET have proposed the use of the OME-XML File as an
image data migration standard. A C++ class that reads OME-XML has been
posted by Peter Majer and Marius Messerli of Bitplane AG on the EAMNET
site. `More <http://www.embl.de/eamnet/html/downloads.html>`_ Thanks
to Peter and Marius for this.

Applied Precision, LLC has released an image visualisation tool that
reads and writes OME-XML.
`Details <http://www.api.com/softworx-explorer.asp>`_

Scientific Volume Imaging has included support for the OME-XML file
format in there Huygens Software, a collection of Fluorescence
Microscope image processing packages. The packages are available for
many software platforms.
`More info <http://support.svi.nl/wiki/HuygensSoftware>`_

Improvision joins the ever-increasing list of commercial solution
providers that supports OME-TIFF. Support is available from the release
of Version 4.2.
