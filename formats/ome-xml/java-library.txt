OME-XML Java Library
====================


The OME-XML Java library is a collection of Java packages for
manipulating OME-XML metadata structures. The OME-XML Java library's
metadata processing facilities form the backbone of the
:bf_plone:`Bio-Formats <>` library's support for OME-XML conversion.

It is not to be confused with the 
:legacy_plone:`OME-Java API <ome-server/developer/java-api>`
for communicating with an :legacy_plone:`OME Server <ome-server>`
from Java—previously, the OME-Java library was a combination of both
the OME-XML Java library and the OME-Java API in one package, but as of
September 2008 they have been split into two separate libraries:
**ome-xml.jar** is the OME-XML Java library, and **ome-java.jar** is
the OME-Java API.

Download
--------

You can download **ome-xml.jar** from the 
:bf_plone:`Bio-Formats downloads <downloads>` page. The
license is `LGPL <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html>`_.

Installation
------------

To use, add **ome-xml.jar** to your classpath or build path.

Usage
-----

Refer to the 
`online API documentation <http://hudson.openmicroscopy.org.uk/view/Bio-Formats/job/BIOFORMATS-trunk/javadoc>`_,
specifically the ome.xml.\* packages. For an example of usage, see the
`Bio-Formats metadata architecture <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/browser/bioformats.git/components/scifio/src/loci/formats/ome/OMEXMLMetadataImpl.java>`_.

The OMENode is the root ("OME") node of the OME-XML. Each XML element
has its own node type (e.g. "Image" has ImageNode) with its own
accessor and mutator methods, to make navigation of the OME-XML
structure easier than it would be with a raw DOM object. However, there
are some limitations to what can be done with the API. If your
application needs access to a node's backing DOM element to work with it
directly, you can call ``getDOMElement()`` on a node.

Source code
-----------

The OME-XML Java library is an open source project—the source code is
freely accessible via our Git repository. See 
:bf_doc:`these instructions <developers/source-code>` for details on accessing 
the code.
