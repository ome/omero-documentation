The OME-XML Format
==================

OME-XML is a project to provide support for the exchange of microscope
imaging data within the field of life sciences. Its key aspects include
support for collaborative sharing of data between labs who may be using
different apparatus, and the safeguarding of crucial metadata associated
with image files, that can be lost when they are moved across systems (or
in many cases, never recorded at all).

The term "OME-XML" applies to two interrelated but distinct things:

#. A `data model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model>`_ for
   representing microscopy metadata, for use with microscopy file
   formats, expressed as an `XML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>`_
   schema.
#. A `file format <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format>`_ for
   storing microscopy information (both pixels and metadata) using the
   OME-XML data model.

.. note:: OME-XML as a file format is somewhat superseded by OME-TIFF, which 
    is the preferred container format for OME-XML encoded metadata.

The purpose of OME-XML is to provide a rich, extensible way to save
information concerning microscopy experiments and the images acquired
therein, including:

-  dimensional parameters defining the scope of the image pixels
   (e.g. resolution, number of focal planes, number of time points, number of
   channels)
-  the hardware configuration used to acquire the image planes
   (e.g. microscope, detectors, lenses, filters)
-  the settings used with said hardware (e.g. physical size of the image
   planes in microns, laser gain and offset, channel configuration)
-  the person performing the experiment
-  some details on the experiment itself, such as a description, what
   type of experiment (e.g. FRET, time lapse, fluorescence lifetime)
   and events occurring during the acquisition (e.g. laser ablation, stage
   motion)
-  additional custom information you may wish to provide about your
   experiment in a structured form (known as 
   :doc:`/developers/structured-annotations`)


Features and applications
-------------------------

The OME-XML file serves as a convenient file format for data migration
from one site or user to another. The OME-XML file captures all image
acquisition and experimental metadata, along with the binary image data,
and packages it into an easily readable package. The
`paper <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_ describing the design
and implementation of the OME-XML file appeared in Genome Biology.

.. note::

    OME-XML files can be read by potentially any software package - you
    do not need OME image management software to use OME-XML.

Some specific features of the OME-XML file format:

-  OME-XML files may contain one or more sets of 5-D pixels, for example
   raw data from a microscope, the deconvolved data, and a volume
   rendered view.
-  OME-XML files contain all the metadata associated with an image,
   including the experimental (e.g. cells, genes) and acquisition
   (e.g. microscope light sources, filters, detectors)
   metadata.
-  OME-XML Image pixels may be stored compressed directly in
   XML with base64 encoding. Compression of the pixels and the metadata
   is supported through widely-available patent-free compression schemes
   (gzip and bzip2). OME-XML Images are addressable by plane.
-  OME-XML files have a built-in mechanism for supporting arbitrary
   user-defined data that can be used globally or attached to Images,
   Features (objects inside Images), and Datasets. Mechanisms for
   OME-compliant systems to populate databases with these user-defined
   fields is part of the specification. See the 
   :doc:`/developers/structured-annotations` XML Schema section.

The OME-XML Schema .xsd files and technical documentation are available on the 
:schema_plone:`Schema pages <>`.


Migrating or sharing data with OME-XML
--------------------------------------

Data saved in an OME-XML file is easily read by any software capable of
reading and interpreting OME-XML. OME software tools can export and
import OME-XML files, but any OME-XML-aware software can be used.

In the figure :ref:`figure-data-workflow`, microscope image data is imported 
into My OME Database (more accurately, an instance of OME managing image data 
at one location). After a set of analyses is performed, this data is exported
in its entirety (i.e. including binary image data, image metadata, and
the associated analytic results) and then passed to a collaborator's OME
database ("Your OME Database"). This strategy packages analytic data
together with the image data to ensure none of the critical
interpretative information is lost.

Ongoing development
-------------------

The ongoing development of the OME-XML data model can be tracked on
http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome.

Users can also add work tickets to the system detailing any changes they
feel should be made.
