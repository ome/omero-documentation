OME Model and Formats |release| Documentation
#############################################


A major goal of the OME project is the provision of common
specifications for light microscopy file formats. Most light microscope
data is collected using proprietary software. In general, users must
convert files between formats to access different processing or display
functionality. Migration between different formats is laborious, but
most importantly often results in loss of critical image metadata.

The OME consortium has three projects providing tools for standardized
file formats: OME-XML, OME-TIFF, and Bio-Formats. The definition,
development, and maintenance of these tools are the result of close
collaboration between all academic and commercial partners in the OME
Consortium.

The version *4* releases use the *June 2012* release of the OME-Model.

The version *5* releases use the *June 2013* release of the OME-Model.

The OME Model is a specification for storing data on biological imaging.
The model includes image parameters, such as XYZ dimensions and pixels type, 
as well as extensive metadata on, for example, image acquisition, annotation, 
and regions of interest (ROIs). This common specification is essential
for the exchange of image data between different software packages.


-  The latest specification for OME-XML is available on our website
   :schema_plone:`schema location <>` pages.

-  If you have used OME-XML, OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats or OMERO in your work
   find the 
   :about_plone:`correct citations <licensing-attribution/citing-ome>` to use.

We have received support from several companies who use our file formats, for 
details see our list of :about_plone:`Partners <partners>`.


********
OME-TIFF
********

.. only:: html

    The **OME Data Model** is implemented as the **OME-TIFF** file format. 
    OME-TIFF is a multi-plane tiff file that contains OME metadata in the 
    header, in the form of **OME-XML**. This allows the pixels to be read with 
    any TIFF-compatible program and the metadata to be extracted with any 
    OME-aware application.

*******
OME-XML
*******

.. only:: html

    The OME-XML file serves as a convenient file format for data migration
    from one site or user to another. The OME-XML file captures all image
    acquisition and experimental metadata along with the binary image data
    and packages it into an easily readable package. Our
    `paper <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_ describing the design
    and implementation of the OME-XML File appeared in Genome Biology.

    The **OME-XML Java library** is a collection of Java packages for
    manipulating OME-XML metadata structures which you can download to work 
    with yourself.
