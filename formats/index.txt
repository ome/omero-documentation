#############################################

This documentation covers the OME Data Model, OME-XML and OME-TIFF. 

The OME Model is a specification for storing data on biological imaging.
The model includes image parameters, such as XYZ dimensions and pixels type, 
as well as extensive metadata on, for example, image acquisition, annotation, 
and regions of interest (ROIs). This common specification is essential
for the exchange of image data between different software packages. OME-XML is 
a file format used to store data according to the OME Model, serving as a 
convenient file format for data migration from one site or user to another. 
OME-TIFF is a multi-plane tiff file that contains OME metadata in the header, 
in the form of OME-XML. This allows the pixels to be read with any 
TIFF-compatible program, and the metadata to be extracted with any OME-aware 
application. Our `paper describing the design and implementation of the OME-XML file 
<http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_ appeared in Genome Biology.

The OME consortium currently provides two major tools capable of working
with OME-XML and OME-TIFF:

-  The :bf_plone:`Bio-Formats <>` library is a full-featured library with many 
   features related to OME-XML, including conversion of third party file 
   format metadata into OME-XML structures. It can write image data to the 
   OME-TIFF format.

-  The :omero_plone:`OMERO server <>` works directly with
   OME-XML. It can import data from OME-XML and OME-TIFF, as well as
   export to OME-TIFF.



If you have used OME-XML, OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats or OMERO in your work please 
use the :about_plone:`correct citations <licensing-attribution/citing-ome>` to 
acknowledge us.

We have received support from several companies who use our file formats, for 
details see our list of :about_plone:`Partners <partners>`.
