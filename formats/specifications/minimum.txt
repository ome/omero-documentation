Minimum Specification
=====================


This was developed in conjunction with the September 2009 release of the
OME-XML Model and has been updated to the June 2013 release.

A minimum specification OME file has been defined. This is best viewed
as being the minimum required for the display of an image. A sample of
the structure is:

::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <ome:OME xmlns:bf="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/BinaryFile/2013-06"
        xmlns:ome="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2013-06"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2013-06
                            http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2013-06/ome.xsd">
        <ome:Image ID="Image:1" Name="Name92">
            <ome:AcquisitionDate>2009-03-16T15:41:51.0Z</ome:AcquisitionDate>
            <ome:Pixels 
                ID="Pixels:1" 
                DimensionOrder="XYZCT" 
                Type="int8" 
                SizeX="2" 
                SizeY="2" 
                SizeZ="2"
                SizeC="2" 
                SizeT="2">
                <bf:BinData 
                    BigEndian="false" 
                    Compression="none" 
                    Length="12"
                    >ZGVmYXVsdA==</bf:BinData>
            </ome:Pixels>
        </ome:Image>
    </ome:OME>
    The data in this sample is nonsense.

Alternative valid forms:

-  would have a ``<ome:TiffData/>`` block instead of the ``bf:BinData``
   block (this would be used in the header of an OME-TIFF file)
-  would have a ``<ome:MetadataOnly/>`` block instead of the ``bf:BinData``
   block (this would be used in the header of a metadata-only OME file)
