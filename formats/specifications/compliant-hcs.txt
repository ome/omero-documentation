Compliant HCS Specification
===========================


OME Compliant HCS File Specification. This was developed in conjunction
with the June 2010 release of the OME-XML Model and has been updated to the 
June 2013 release.

A compliant specification for HCS OME files has been defined. This is
not the minimum required for the display of an image, that is the
:doc:`Minimum Specification <minimum>`. This is the
information a file should contain to be useful while
conforming to the spirit of the OME projects aims.

This sample structure is based on Sample One in the 
OME Compliant File Specification 
(see :doc:`index`):

    The data in this sample is nonsense.

Alternative valid forms:

-  would have a ``ome:TiffData`` block instead of the ``bf:BinData`` block 
   (this would be used in the header of an OME-TIFF file)
-  would have a ``ome:MetadataOnly`` block instead of the ``bf:BinData`` 
   block (this would **ONLY** be acceptable if the image data of the file
   **CANNOT** be represented in an OME file for technical reasons)
