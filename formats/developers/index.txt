Developer Introduction
======================


All the OME code is stored in a central Git repository. The OME Data
Model part of this is available under :sourcedir:`components/specification`.

There are sample files, along with an explanation of their structure, on
the :doc:`sample-files` page.


OME Model development process
-----------------------------

Regular meetings are held to review the model and discuss additions or
changes. Before making any changes, we come up with a proposal. This
outlines the changes required and why we think it is necessary. We can then
publish this to the OME community and provide links to the relevant
work tickets. We generally only publish major changes or breaking
changes in advance. Minor additions can usually be safely made so these
are just published on release. We regularly ask the community for
comments on what they would like added, especially when we are moving
into a new imaging area.

Process workflow:

-  Write a document that we can attach to the relevant ticket
-  Propose time frames for announcement, implementation
-  If elements have to be removed/replaced, make an announcement to the
   community
-  Generate UML diagrams
-  Generate the updated XSD files
-  Generate XSLT to transform XML files
-  Write same files
-  Write tests
-  Include into next Schema Release. It is worth noting that at present
   we are trying to keep schema changes in step with new versions of
   OMERO so they are released simultaneous. This is why the tickets for
   OME-XML development have been moved to the main `OME
   Trac <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome>`_

Working with the OME Data Model
-------------------------------

The :doc:`Model Overview collection of diagrams <model-overview>` shows the 
structure and connections between different parts of the OME Model.

Individual parts of the model are covered in more detail in the following 
sections:

-  :doc:`Filter And FilterSet <filter-and-filterset>`
-  :doc:`Screen Plate Well <screen-plate-well>` - our HCS solution
-  :doc:`Structured Annotations <structured-annotations>`
-  :doc:`Regions of Interest (ROIs) <roi>`

Support for additional dimensions is also covered:

-  :doc:`6D, 7D and 8D Storage <6d-7d-and-8d-storage>`

Legacy solutions for tiled images and Single (or Selective) Plane Illumination 
Microscopy (also known as Light Sheet Microscopy) are detailed in the 
following sections for reference but **both these methods have been superseded 
by the above**:

-  :doc:`SPIM Initial Support <legacy/spim-initial-support>`
-  :doc:`Tiled Images <legacy/tiled-images>`

The use of IDs and Life Science Identifiers is explained in this section:

-  :doc:`id-and-lsid`

The :doc:`Schema versions</schemas/index>` section shows the Model changes 
with each release, helpful for those working with several versions of the OME 
Model, for example to support the loading/saving of a variety of files.

-  The **current major release** - see :doc:`Changes For June
   2013 </schemas/june-2013>`.

There are two Python applications to aid working with OME-XML - 
:doc:`EnumTool`, which is designed to digest OME-XML schema and
produce meaningful output about enumerations, and :doc:`xsd-fu`,
which digests OME XML schema and produces an object oriented Java
infrastructure to ease  work with an XML DOM tree.

-  See :doc:`using-ome-xml` for further guidance on how to use OME 
   schema elements in XML files.
