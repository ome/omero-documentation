xsd-fu
======


xsd-fu is a Python application designed to digest OME XML schema and
generate a class hierarchy to ease work with an XML DOM tree.  It can
output code in multiple languages; Java is currently fully supported,
with C++ support being added.

Checking out the source
-----------------------

::

    git clone git://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats.git

xsd-fu is in :file:`components/xsd-fu`


Running the code generator
--------------------------

`Genshi <http://genshi.edgewall.org/>`_ must be installed.  If
missing, install the distribution-provided package, for example
``python-genshi`` on Debian-based systems, or else run

::

    $ pip install genshi

Alternatively, use a downloaded Python ``.egg``, for example:

::

    $ export PYTHONPATH=Genshi-0.5-py2.4-linux-i686.egg

Automatic use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bio-Formats uses ant or maven to build.  Both of these will invoke
xsd-fu as part of the build process, for generating the sources to
build.  Top-level ant targets are ``ome-xml-src`` and
``metadata-src``; individual components have a ``generate-source``
target.

Manual use
^^^^^^^^^^

Run ``xsd-fu`` with no arguments to examine the syntax:

::

    $ ./xsd-fu
    Missing subcommand!
    Usage: ./xsd-fu <subcommand> ...
    Executes an OME-XML Schema definition parsing and code generation subcommand.

    Available subcommands:
      java_classes
      omexml_metadata
      omero_metadata
      metadata_store
      metadata_retrieve
      metadata_aggregate
      enum_types
      enum_handlers
      doc_gen
      tab_gen
      debug

    Report bugs to OME Devel <ome-devel@lists.openmicroscopy.org.uk>

.. note::
    xsd-fu is used for several different types of code generation
    (primarily generation of OME-XML model and metadata classes
    for Bio-Formats, and parts of OMERO) as outlined by the subcommand
    structure above.


Generating the OME-XML Java classes
-----------------------------------

Please refer to :file:`ant/xsd-fu.xml` and the ant :file:`build.xml`
within specific components.


Working with Enumerations and Enumeration Handlers
--------------------------------------------------

xsd-fu contains a flexible, configuration driven structure to code
generate enumeration regular expressions. The configuration file is
located in :file:`components/xsd-fu/cfg`:

-  `https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/blob/develop/components/xsd-fu/cfg/enum\_handler.cfg <https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/blob/develop/components/xsd-fu/cfg/enum_handler.cfg>`_

Each enumeration has a key-value listing of regular expression to exact
enumeration value matches. For example:

::

    ...
    [Correction]
    ".*Pl.*Apo.*" = "PlanApo"
    ".*Pl.*Flu.*" = "PlanFluor"
    "^\\s*Vio.*Corr.*" = "VioletCorrected"
    ".*S.*Flu.*" = "SuperFluor"
    ".*Neo.*flu.*" = "Neofluar"
    ".*Flu.*tar.*" = "Fluotar"
    ".*Fluo.*" = "Fluor"
    ".*Flua.*" = "Fluar"
    "^\\s*Apo.*" = "Apo"
    ...

Generating OMERO model specification files
------------------------------------------

::

    $ cd components/xsd-fu
    $ ./xsd-fu omero_model ../specification/InProgress/ome.xsd ../specification/InProgress/SPW.xsd \
            ../specification/InProgress/SA.xsd ../specification/InProgress/ROI.xsd
    $ ls OmeroModel.xml
