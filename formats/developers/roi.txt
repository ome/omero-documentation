ROI Model
=========

ROIs are a top level object within the OME node of the model. This
means that they can be referred to from more than one point within the model:

-  They can be referenced by an Image node.
-  They can be referenced by a MicrobeamManipulation node.
-  They can be standalone - we interpret this as meaning they are a
   template that could be applied by the user to images.

.. note::

    A fourth case is possible but not recommended. It is possible for
    one ROI to be referenced by both an Image node and a
    MicrobeamManipulation node. The problem with this is the ROI for the
    MicrobeamManipulation should be fixed, but the ROI on an Image is
    something that should be editable by a user. In this case, the user
    can inadvertently change the ROI set during the
    MicrobeamManipulation without realizing it.


ROI attributes and simple children
----------------------------------

The ROI node has some basic properties attached to it:

-  An ID used to reference it from the Image and MicrobeamManipulation
   nodes.
-  A namespace used to identify the category of ROI to a specific
   application (optional).
-  A short name for the ROI used in the user interface (optional).
-  A longer description for the ROI used in the user interface
   (optional).
-  An annotation reference linking an annotation to this ROI (optional).

ROI complex children
--------------------

The ROI node has a choice of ONE child operation node. At the moment, the
only choice is Union, meaning it is composed of the union of all its
child shapes. It is implemented as a choice so we have the option
available of adding other composition methods in the future. There are 
currently no plans in place for this however.

Shape nodes
-----------

The shape nodes define the geometry and appearance of the ROI. Each
shape is a 2D object that exists within a single Z plane of an Image.
(This will change with a future version of the schema).

Shape attributes and simple children
------------------------------------

The shape node has five groups of information, four of which are
attributes or simple children.

-  General

   -  A short name for the Shape used in the user interface (optional).


-  Links to Planes

   -  TheZ - the z-section this Shape is on (optional, if not specified
      then all the z-sections).
   -  TheT - the timepoint this Shape is at (optional, if not specified
      then all the timepoints).
   -  TheC - the channel this Shape is on (optional, if not specified
      then all the channels).


-  Shape Display Options

   -  FillColor - the color of the fill - encoded as RGBA (optional).
   -  FillRule - which parts of the Shape to fill (optional).
   -  StrokeColor - the color of the stroke (optional).
   -  StrokeWidth - the width of the stroke in pixels (optional).
   -  StrokeDashArray - e.g. "none", "10 20 30 10" (optional).
   -  LineCap - the shape of the end of the line (optional).
   -  Text - a text label that can optionally be displayed on the Shape
      (optional).
   -  FontFamily - the font family used to draw the text (optional).
   -  FontSize - the size of the font in points (optional).
   -  FontStyle - the style applied to the text (optional).
   -  Visible - The shape is visible if set to true, hidden otherwise
      (optional).


-  Geometry Adjustment

   -  Transform - a transformation matrix represented by 6 values
      (optional).


Shape complex children
----------------------

The fifth part is the geometry. The Shape node has a choice of EIGHT
child geometry nodes. At the moment the choice is:

-  Ellipse - specified by a centre point, a radius in the X-axis, and
   a radius in the Y-axis.
-  Label - specified by a start point for the baseline for the first
   character.
-  Line - specified by two end points, a markerStart (any marker applied
   to the start of the line e.g. an arrowhead) and markerEnd (any
   marker applied to the end of the line e.g. an arrowhead) (optional).
-  Mask - specified by an upper left corner and a BinData block.
-  Point - a simple x, y position.
-  Polygon - specified by an array of coordinates that are connected by
   straight lines that are closed, a markerStart (any marker applied to
   the start of the line e.g. an arrowhead) and markerEnd
   (any marker applied to the end of the line e.g. an arrowhead)
   (optional).
-  Polyline - specified by an array of coordinates that are connected by
   straight lines, a markerStart (any marker applied to the start of the
   line e.g. an arrowhead) and markerEnd (any marker applied
   to the end of the line e.g. an arrowhead) (optional).
-  Rectangle - specified by an upper left corner and a width and height.

3D ROI
------

The current method of defining a ROI in three dimensions is as a Union
of Shape objects, each of which defines the geometry where that 3D ROI
would cut the 2D Plane the Shape is attached to.
