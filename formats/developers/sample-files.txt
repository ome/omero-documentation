Sample Image Files
==================


Sample OME-XML and OME-TIFF files can be found here: 
:schema_plone:`Samples <Samples/>`.

Structure of the samples
------------------------

Each schema version's samples are located in a folder named after the schema's
date

e.g. folder ``2013-06`` has samples using schema version
:schema_plone:`http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2013-06 <OME/2013-06>`.

There are two sets of samples that were designed to be small enough to
examine in detail:

-  ``18x24y*-text*`` are 18 by 24 pixel images, with black and white
   text on each plane giving its time, z-depth and channel e.g. C1 Z1
   T1
-  ``6x4y*-swatch`` are 6 by 4 pixel images, that have a black and white
   pattern in the first 2 x-columns, followed by a grey scale pattern in
   the next 4 columns.

The file names contain:
``x`` size, ``y`` size, ``z`` depth, ``t`` timepoints, ``c`` channels,
and ``b`` bitdepth

-  A file ending in ``.ome`` is the OME-XML version
-  A file ending in ``.ome.tiff`` is the OME-TIFF version
   that matches the OME-XML version


Sample details
--------------

This is a list of all the examples for the 2010-06 Schema Version. While
most are available in all the schema versions, some files are only
available in the later versions.

-  ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch-1s1p4w2ws.ome`` 
   contains 11 images. This file shows how these images can be
   attached to wells within a plate.

-  ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch-2s2p4w2ws.ome`` 
   contains 22 images. This file shows how two plates and two
   screens can be linked together.

-  ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch-instrument.ome`` 
   has a single image with an instrument using lights sources,
   detectors, objectives and filters (most of the other examples do not 
   contain any instrument data).

-  ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch-tagged.ome`` 
   has a single image with two tags and a tagset
   attached to it using annotations.

-  ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch-xmlannotation-svg.ome`` 
   has a single image. The image has a block of XML data
   attached to it using annotations. The XML data is SVG in this
   example but could be any well formed XML.

-  ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch.ome`` 
   has a single image. This file is the one on which the other
   files are based.

-  ``6x4y1z1t3c8b-swatch-ROI.ome`` 
   has a single image, but that image has 3 channels. There are
   3 ROIs defined, two on only a single channel and one that applies to
   all the channels.

-  ``6x4y1z1t3c8b-swatch.ome`` 
   has a single image, but that image has 3 channels.
    
-  ``18x24y1z5t1c8b-text.ome`` 
   has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
   timepoints.

-  ``18x24y1z5t2c8b-text.ome`` 
   has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
   timepoints. Each of these timepoints has 2 channels to give a total
   of 10 bit planes.

-  ``18x24y5z1t1c8b-text.ome`` 
   has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
   z-sections.

-  ``18x24y5z1t2c8b-text.ome`` 
   has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
   z-sections. Each of these z-sections has 2 channels to give a total
   of 10 bit planes.

-  ``18x24y5z5t1c8b-metadata.ome`` 
   defines a single image. The image is defined as having pixels
   for 5 z-sections. Each of these z-sections has 5 timepoints to give
   a total of 25 bit planes. This is a metadata-only file. It only has
   the metadata defining the image, not any of the pixel data.

-  ``18x24y5z5t1c8b-text.ome`` 
   has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
   z-sections. Each of these z-sections has 5 timepoints to give a
   total of 25 bit planes.

-  ``18x24y5z5t2c8b-text.ome`` 
   has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
   z-sections. Each of these z-sections has 5 timepoints. Each of these
   timepoints has 2 channels to give a total of 50 bit planes.
