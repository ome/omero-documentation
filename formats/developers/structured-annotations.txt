Structured Annotations
======================


Structured annotations (or SAs), introduced in the 
:doc:`2008-09 schema </schemas/september-2008>`,
are a general way to extend OME-XML with additional structured
information. They can express a variety of data types and linkages, and
serve as a replacement for the Custom Attributes and Semantic Type
Definitions functionality of prior schemas.

For more information on SAs from an OMERO-centric perspective, see the
:omero_doc:`OMERO page on structured
annotations <developers/Modules/StructuredAnnotations>`.

The structure of the SA used in the schema is shown below,
along with all the possible attachment points in the model.
