Continuous integration
======================


The OME project uses `Jenkins <http://jenkins-ci.org>`_ as a continuous
integration server. To access the OME Jenkins server, bring up a web
browser and go to http://ci.openmicroscopy.org.

The following sections summarize the main continuous integration jobs used for
the development of OMERO, Bio-Formats and the OME documentation sets. Note
this is not an exhaustive list of all jobs in the project. To know more about
a particular job, click on the :guilabel:`Configure` button on the left-side
panel of the job window.
