Continuous integration (scc) scripts
====================================

https://github.com/openmicroscopy/snoopycrimecop hosts a series of utility
scripts used in the continuous integration.

If you find a bug or if you want an additional feature to be implemented,
please `open an issue <https://github.com/openmicroscopy/snoopycrimecop/issues>`_.

Installation
------------

The scc tools are a set of Python_ based utility programs. The tools suite
can be installed using ``pip``::

	$ pip install -U scc

If your Python is old then this may also install the **PyGithub** and
**argparse** packages, but since Python 2.7 **argparse** is already included
with the standard library.

Github connection
-----------------

.. _About Two-Factor Authentication: https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication
.. _Creating an access token for command-line use: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use

Most of the scc commands instantiate a Github connection using the PyGithub
package. GitHub strongly recommends to turn on two-factor authentification
(2FA), see `About Two-Factor Authentication`_ for more details. If 2FA is
activated, the only way to use scc commands creating a GitHub connection is to
create an OAuth token, see
`Creating an access token for command-line use`_
for details on how to create Personal Access Tokens via the GitHub interface.
This token can then be stored in the global Git configuration file::

	git config --global github.token REPLACE_BY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN

Unless the :option:`--token` option is passed to the scc command, the
command first looks for the `github.token` specified in the git config file
and, if found, uses this token to connect to GitHub::

	$ scc merge master --info -v
	2013-01-16 22:03:49,633 [  scc.config] DEBUG Found github.token
	...

If no token is found, the command looks for a `github.user` in the git config
file and, if found, uses this username to connect to Github::

	$ scc merge master --info -v
	2013-01-16 22:06:00,256 [  scc.config] DEBUG Found github.user
	Enter password for http://github.com/sbesson:

.. note::
   The password to be entered here is the GitHub password. Connecting using
   the GitHub username/password is NOT possible if 2FA has been activated.

Finally, if no token or user is found, both the GitHub username and password
are queried at the prompt::

	$ scc merge master --info -v
	# github.token and github.user not found.
	# See `scc token` for simpifying use.
	Username or token: sbesson
	Enter password for http://github.com/sbesson:

.. _scc merge:

scc merge
---------

.. program:: scc merge

Merge all the open PRs based on specified branch, including all submodules.

The first argument is the name of the base branch of origin, e.g.::

	$ scc merge develop

.. option:: --comment

	Add a comment to the PR if there is a conflict while merging the PR
	::

		$ scc merge develop --comment

.. option:: --default <type>, -D <type>

	Specify the default set of PRs to be included in the merge

	Four options are currently implemented: `none`, `mine`, `org` and `all`.
	By default (`org`), only PRs opened by public members of the repository
	organization are included so the following are equivalent::

		$ scc merge develop
		$ scc merge develop --default org
		$ scc merge develop -D org

.. option:: --exclude <filters>, -E <filters>

	Exclude PR by label, user or number

	Label filters can be specified using `label:my_label`::

		$ scc merge develop -E label:exclude_label

	User filters can be specified using `user:username`::

		$ scc merge develop -E user:my_user

	PR filters can be specified using `pr:number` or `#number`::

		$ scc merge develop -E pr:45 -E #46

	Submodule PR filters can be specified using `submodule_name#number`::

		$ scc merge develop -E bioformats#40

	If no key is specified, it is assumed the filter is a label filter.

	By default, only PRs labeled as `exclude` are excluded so the following
	are equivalent::

		$ scc merge develop
		$ scc merge develop -E label:exclude
		$ scc merge develop -E exclude

.. option:: --include <filters>, -I <filters>

	Include PR by label, user or number

	Label filters can be specified using `label:my_label`::

		$ scc merge develop -I label:exclude_label

	User filters can be specified using `user:username`::

		$ scc merge develop -I user:my_user

	PR filters can be specified using `pr:number` or `#number`::

		$ scc merge develop -I pr:45 -I #46

	Submodule PR filters can be specified using `submodule_name#number`::

		$ scc merge develop -I bioformats#40

	If no key is specified, it is assumed the filter is a label filter.

	By default, only PRs labeled as `include` are included so the following
	are equivalent::

		$ scc merge develop
		$ scc merge develop -I label:include
		$ scc merge develop -I include

.. option:: --check-commit-status <status>, -S <status>

	Exclude PR based on the status of the last commit

	Three options are currently implemented: `none`, `no-error` and
	`success-only`.	By default (`none`), the status of the last commit on the
	PR is not taken into account.
	To include PRs which have a successful status only, e.g. PRs where the
	Travis build is green, use the `success-only` option::

		$ scc merge develop -S success-only

	To exclude all PRs with an `error` or `failure` status, use the `no-error`
	option::

	$ scc merge develop -S no-error

.. option:: --info

	Display the candidate PRs to merge but do not merge them
	::

	$ scc merge develop --info

.. option:: --push <branchname>

	Push the locally merged branch to Github
	::

		$ scc merge develop --push my-merged-branch

.. option:: --reset

	Recursively reset each repository to the HEAD of the base branch
	::

		$ scc merge develop --reset

.. option:: --shallow

	Merge the PRs for the top-level directory only, excluding submodules::

		$ scc merge develop --shallow

.. option:: --remote <remote>

	Specify the name of the remote to use as the origin. Default: origin::

		$ scc merge develop --remote gh

As a concrete example, the first step of the :term:`OMERO-merge-develop` job
is calling the following merge command:

::

	$ scc merge develop --no-ask --reset --comment --push merge/develop/latest


.. versionchanged:: 0.3.0
	Added default values for :option:`--include` and :option:`--exclude`
	options.

.. versionchanged:: 0.3.8
	Added :option:`--shallow` and :option:`--remote` options.

.. versionchanged:: 0.4.0
	Added :option:`--check-commit-status` option.

scc travis-merge
----------------
.. program:: scc travis-merge

Merge PRs in a Travis environment, using the PR comments to generate the merge
filters.

::

	$ scc travis-merge

This command internally defines all the filter options exposed in
:program:`scc merge`.

The target branch is read from the base of the PR, the :option:`--default`
option is set to `none` meaning no PR is merged by default and no default
:option:`--exclude` option is defined.

The :option:`--include` filter is determined by parsing all the PR comments
lines starting with ``--depends-on``. To include PR 67 in the merge, add a
comment line starting with ``--depends-on #67`` to the PR. To include PR 60 of
the bioformats submodules, add a comment line starting with
``--depends-on bioformats#60`` to the PR.

scc update-submodules
---------------------

.. program:: scc update-submodules

Update the pointer of all submodules based on specified branch.

The first argument is the name of the base branch of origin, e.g.::

	$ scc update-submodules develop

.. option:: --push <branchname>

	Push the locally merged branch to Github and open a PR against the base
	branch::

		$ scc merge develop --push submodules_branch

.. option:: --no-pr

	Combined with :option:`--push` option, push the locally merged branch to
	Github but skip PR opening::

		$ scc merge develop --push submodules_branch --no-pr

.. option:: --remote <remote>

	Specify the name of the remote to use as the origin (default: origin)::

		$ scc update-submodules develop --remote gh


scc rebase
----------
.. program:: scc rebase

Rebase a PR (open or closed) onto another branch and open a new PR.

The first argument is the number of the PR to rebase and the second argument
is the name of the branch onto which the PR should be rebased::

	$ scc rebase 142 develop

Assuming the head branch used to open the PR 142 was called `branch_142`, this
command will rebase the tip of `branch_142` onto origin/develop, create a new
local branch called `rebased/develop/branch_142`, push this branch to Github
and open a new PR. Assuming the command opens PR 150, to facilitate the
integration with :program:`scc unrebased-prs`, a ``--rebased-to #150``
comment is added to PR 142 and a ``--rebased-from #142`` comment is
added to the PR 150. Finally, the command will switch back to the original
branch prior to rebasing and delete the local `rebased/develop/branch_142`.

.. note::

	By default, :program:`scc rebase` uses the branches of the `origin` remote
	to rebase the PR. To specify another remote, use the
	:option:`--remote` option.

.. option:: --no-pr

	Skip the opening of the PR
	::

		$ scc rebase 142 develop --no-pr

.. option:: --no-delete

	Do not delete the local rebased branch

	::

		$ scc rebase 142 develop --no-delete

.. option:: --remote <remote>

	Specify the name of the remote to use for the rebase (default: origin)

	::

		$ scc rebase 142 develop --remote snoopycrimecop

.. option:: --continue

	Re-run the command after manually fixing conflicts

	If :program:`scc rebase` fails due to conflict during the rebase, you will
	end up in a detached HEAD state.

	If you want to continue the rebase operation, you will need to manually
	fix the conflicts::

		# fix files locally
		$ git add conflicting_files # add conflicting files
		$ git rebase --continue

	This conflict solving operation may need to be repeated multiple times
	until the branch is fully rebased.

	Once all the conflicts are resolved, call :program:`scc rebase` with the
	:option:`--continue` option::

		$ scc rebase --continue 142 develop

	Depending on the input options, this command will perform all the steps of
	the rebase command (Github pushing, PR opening) skipping the rebase part.

	Alternatively, you can abort the rebase and switch to your previous branch::

		$ git rebase --abort
		$ git checkout old_branch

.. versionchanged:: 0.3.10
	Automatically add ``--rebased-to`` and ``--rebased-from`` comments to the
	source and target PRs.

scc unrebased-prs
-----------------
.. program:: scc unrebased-prs

Compare two development branches and check that PRs merged in one branch have
been merged to the other.

The basic workflow of the :program:`scc unrebased-prs` command is the
following:

- 	list all first-parent merge commits for each branch including git notes
	referenced as `see_also/other_branch` where other_branch is the name of
	the branch to check against.
- 	exclude all merge commits with a note containing either "See gh-" or "n/a"
- 	for each remaining merge commit, parse the PR number and look into the PR
	body/comments for lines starting with ``--rebased-to``, ``--rebased-from``
	or ``--no-rebase``.

Additionally, for each line of each PR starting with ``--rebased-to`` or
``--rebased-from``, the existence of a matching line is checked in the
corresponding source/target PR. For instance, if PR 70 has a
``--rebased-from #67`` line and a ``--rebased-from #66`` line, then both PRs
66 and 67 should have a ``--rebased-to #70`` line.

This command requires two positional arguments corresponding to the name of
the branch of origin to compare::

	$ scc unrebased-prs dev_4_4 develop

.. option:: --shallow

	Look for unrebased PRs in the top-level directory only, excluding
	submodules::

		$ scc unrebased-prs dev_4_4 develop --shallow

.. option:: --remote <remote>

	Specify the name of the remote to use as the origin (default: origin)::

		$ scc unrebased-prs dev_4_4 develop --remote gh

.. option:: --no-check

	Do not check links between rebased comments::

		$ scc unrebased-prs dev_4_4 develop --no-check

.. versionadded:: 0.3.10
	Added support for body/comment parsing and ``--rebased-to/from``
	linkcheck

.. versionchanged:: 0.4.0
	Improved command output and added support for submodule processing

scc version
-----------
.. program:: scc version

Return the version of the scc tools::

	$ scc version
	0.3.0

.. versionadded:: 0.2.0

.. _scc deploy:

scc deploy
----------

.. program:: scc deploy

Deploy a website update using `file symlink replacement <https://gist.github.com/datagrok/3807742#file-symlink-replacement-md>`_::

	$ scc deploy folder

The goal of this command is to enable overwriting of deployed doc content and
allow for “hot-swapping” content served by Apache without downtime and HTTP
404s.

.. option:: --init

	Prepare folder for symlink replacement. Should only be run once

	::

		$ scc deploy folder --init

.. versionadded:: 0.3.1

The hudson jobs :term:`BIOFORMATS-docs-merge-stable`,
:term:`BIOFORMATS-docs-merge-develop`, :term:`OMERO-docs-merge-stable`,
:term:`OMERO-docs-merge-develop` and OMERO-docs-internal deploy the
documentation artifacts to necromancer. The target directory (sphinx-docs) is
controlled by the hudson:hudson user, so all file system operations are
allowed. Each job has the target directory configured in the SSH publisher
target directory property. After deployment has happened to a temporary
directory, a series of symlink moves happens making sure that the symlink
points to the updated content.

scc check-status
----------------
.. program:: scc check-status

Check the status of the Github API::

	$ scc check-status && echo "Passing"
	Passing

.. option:: -n <N>

	Display N last status messages from Github API history::

		$ scc check-status -n 4
		2013-11-04 13:40:48 (minor) We're investigating an increase in error responses from the API.
		2013-11-04 14:33:55 (good) Everything operating normally.
		2013-11-05 12:59:50 (minor) We're investigating reports of an increase in 502s from the GitHub API.
		2013-11-05 13:07:15 (good) Everything operating normally.


.. versionadded:: 0.4.0
