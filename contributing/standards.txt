Development standards
=====================

Rationale and vision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Various developers have been working on the OMERO project for up to 5
years. Each time the team grows\ :sup:`a`, we are reminded that the
project's development practices must be more mature and transparent. The
initial learning curve for new developers must be minimized.

In order for any of the aforementioned goals to be achieved there must
be better communication, better division of work and better management
and ownership of certain parts of the codebase.

These ideals are not just a function of project size, but a culmination
of factors including: geographically disperse developers (at least 9
time zones), increasing numbers of new developers, complexity of our
code base and the sheer amount of commit activity. In addition, we have
also seen increasing numbers of external developers who want to
*plug-in* to OME technology, maintainership gives them a clear
understanding of who to come to for support and direction.

Code cleanliness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is absolutely nothing worse or more infuriating than attempting to
review or look at messy code. Messy code is an absolute pain to debug or
review and just shows disrespect for other developers time. In short:

-  Intent should be clear
-  Methods should be well documented (yes, with Javadoc)
-  No one should require 1600x1200 resolution to read your code
-  Anyone should be able to see the entire method in one or two pages of
   text

All sounds rather vague doesn't it? What about <insert specific question
here>?

Well, we will have a *house* set of coding style guidelines that
everyone will adhere to without exceptions; you are not developing Perl
scripts in your basement to sort photos of your grandmother. This
*house* set of style guidelines will evolve over the next few weeks.
People are welcome to speak up for things that they would prefer or pet
peeves that they have. I will be pulling general wisdom from the
following:

-  `Mozilla Coding Style
   Guide <http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/mozilla-style-guide.html>`_
-  `Mono Coding
   Guidelines <http://www.mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines>`_
-  `GNU Coding
   Standards <http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/index.html>`_
-  …

First versions of our coding styles are available from git at:

-  :sourcedir:`docs/styles`

Eventually all code will be formatted using these settings and the
`Eclipse 3.1+ <http://eclipse.org>`_ formatter. Because the OMERO Java
and Python source files are encoded in UTF-8, ensure that the encoding
in Eclipse
(:menuselection:`Preferences --> General --> Workspace --> Text file encoding`)
is also set to UTF-8. A policy of UTF-8 encoding for C++ source files is under
consideration, along with instructions for configuring MSVC accordingly.

Security
~~~~~~~~

Security is a both a personal interest of mine (Chris) and something
that I believe to be extremely important in software design. Moving to a
new set of frameworks and technology also gives us an opportunity to
rethink some of our priorities, security in particular. For almost the
duration of the OME project, security practices (access control, user
management, database authentication, etc.) have been poor or
non-existent. Now is the time to change that. Over the next few weeks I
will be adding to this page relevant talks and suggestions as well as
integrating these concepts into the code style guide.

For now, a few talks (okay… just one for now) from some Java security
professionals:

-  ` XCon 2005 Talk <http://xcon.xfocus.org/XCon2005/archives/2005/Xcon2005_Marc_Schoenefeld.pdf>`_

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Without good communication, all the other concepts fall down. To this
end, several weekly or monthly conference calls are arranged to report
on status. See :community_plone:`Conference calls <minutes/conference-calls>`
for times and login information.

Review meetings how to
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Before meeting

   -  Try to close everything, or explain why still open.
   -  Review unscheduled and upcoming (next iteration) tickets.
   -  Move unscheduled tickets to cycle where sensible.
   -  Move cycle-unscheduled tickets to next iteration where sensible.

-  Scheduling

   -  Discuss what new came out of the closed tickets.
   -  Discuss why open tickets are open.
   -  Evaluate how well the previous iteration was planned.
   -  Move backlog (unfinished tickets) to next iteration or unschedule.
   -  Move other tickets to next iteration
   -  If next iteration is too full, prioritize and reschedule.

-  After meeting

   -  Place review notes at
      `http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/milestone/`\ <your-cycle-here>

For information on team communication and process see :doc:`policies`.

Acknowledgement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Maintain a list of contributors, similar to
   :about_plone:`contributors <contributers>`.
-  When a script is submitted:

   ::

       Script approved by <name of team member who validates> on <date>.
       Tested on OMERO <version. Script behaves as described.
       Expected to work on all <version> servers. 

-  Merge or Integrate a patch:

   -  ``<commit text> (modified/based/adapted from patch by <name of contributor>``
      e.g.
      ` commit 1d14c75d91 <https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/commit/1d14c75d91988bcbff445e9860d084e2604fc63a>`_
      or
      ` commit 650b0f42fd <https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/commit/650b0f42fd429580da06c39d7846e8126cf26491>`_

-  When fixing a problem:

   -  \*
      ``<commit text> as pointed out by/courtesy of <name of contributor>``
      e.g.
      ` commit 77cc88a747 <https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/commit/77cc88a747b664b0e6435d294f5f6ee3e4a2148b>`_
      or
      ` commit 08a1543e95 <https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/commit/08a1543e95df781b547eac2ce487b036f5a51343>`_

Logging
~~~~~~~

At present, there are uses of System.out.println throughout the code
base. These are being removed. Apache logging is used and should be
throughout and consistently. Also, the following should NOT be used.

::

     log.debug("My output text");

The log statements should be wrapped with checking logic for appropriate
warning LEVEL configuration. This is done like so.

::

     if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
       log.debug("My output text will work if debug LEVEL logging is on.");
     }

When your logging statements are wrapped, all logging can be turned on
or off very easily in the configuration file(s). Before you can use a
logger you will need to declare one at the top of each class like so.

::

     private static Log log = LogFactory.getLog(YourSpecificClassName.class);


Exception handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we all know, the easy thing to do in a catch block is to use the
printStackTrace method. Do not leave these. We are removing these and
replacing them with something similar to this below.

::

     catch (IOException ioex) {
        log.error("Could not write to file", ioex);
     }

The getCause() method is used to pass the Throwable exception to the
log. Any stacktrace output will be sent to the log. Please remember that
sometimes a new Exception is thrown, possibly to support the method or a
ResourceError is created. The ResourceError is handled like so.

::

     catch (IOException e)
     {
       log.error("Could not read from file", e);
       throw new ResourceError(e.getMessage() + " Please check server log.");
     }

Under consideration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This list was initially a starting point for discussion for the
:community_plone:`September 2008 Dundee Developers meeting <minutes/meetings/september-2008-dundee-developer>`:

    The following topics are all **completely open** for anyone to add
    or veto (please don't delete). Some we already do, some are highly
    questionable. It is also unlikely that we would even be able to
    implement all such "standards" at once, but it would be good to have
    some guidelines as well as a list of things we would like to try for
    moving forward.

Client interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  icons (list of used icons to reuses)
-  communicates, warnings, buttons

   -  dialog boxes

:sup:`a`: As for September 2008, roughly a dozen developers were working
on OMERO.
