    :jenkinsjob:`OME-5.0-release-trigger`

        This job triggers the release jobs. Prior to running it, its variables
        need to be properly configured:

        - :envvar:`RELEASE` is the release number for OMERO and Bio-Formats.
        - :envvar:`ANNOUNCEMENT_URL` is the URL of the forum release
          announcement and should be set to the value of the URL of the
          private post until it becomes public.
        - :envvar:`MILESTONE` is the name of the Trac milestone which the
          download pages should be linked to.
