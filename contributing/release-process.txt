Release process
===============

This page describes the steps to follow for releasing OMERO and Bio-Formats.

Repositories
------------

A set of release scripts are hosted under
https://github.com/openmicroscopy/ome-release. These scripts are executed
by the `OME-release` jobs.

Jenkins jobs
------------

The following table lists the main Jenkins jobs used during the release
process depending on the release branch (4.4 or 5.0 release). All release
jobs should be listed under the :jenkinsview:`Release` view.

.. list-table::

The following instructions use the point/minor release jobs as examples. For
the major release process, the jobs used in these instructions should be
replaced with the corresponding jobs in the table above. Specific distinctions
between major and minor/point release processes will be described in the text.

Release preparation
-------------------

Environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prior to running the job, its variables need to be properly configured:

- :envvar:`RELEASE` is the release number for OMERO and Bio-Formats.
- :envvar:`ANNOUNCEMENT_URL` is the URL of the forum release announcement and
  should be set to the value of the URL of the private post until it becomes
  public.
- :envvar:`MILESTONE` is the name of the Trac milestone which the download
  pages should be linked to.

Last minute PRs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prior to running the job, its variables need to be properly configured:

- A Bio-Formats PR must be opened to bump the version number
  in Maven. This step should be removed in future versions.
- Check that the submodule pointers are up to date. This can
  be done by merging the PRs from the submods jobs.

Release review
--------------

- Click :guilabel:`Build` on :jenkinsjob:`OMERO-4.4-release`, 
  :jenkinsjob:`OMERO-5.0-release` or :jenkinsjob:`OMERO-5.1-release`. The tag
  chosen for the job should be unique, and not exist under the download
  directory or on GitHub.
- Release folders will be created under :file:`/ome/data_repo/public/omero`
  and :file:`/ome/data_repo/public/bio-formats` named with the release number
  specified by the :envvar:`RELEASE` job variable.
- Download pages will be generated pointing at the OMERO and Bio-Formats,
  linkchecked and archived as artifacts.

Release components review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Set up servers for testing with the latest release of the OMERO.server
  built with the different Ice versions.
- Test the OMERO clients (OMERO.insight, OMERO.editor, OMERO.importer) for all
  versions of Ice under Windows, Linux and MacOSX.
- Test the OMERO.server built with the different Ice versions.
- Test the OMERO ImageJ plugin.
- Test the OMERO.matlab toolbox.
- Test the OMERO Virtual Appliance.
- Test the Java Webstart from the deployed server.
- For Bio-Formats, test the **loci_tools.jar**, the command-line tools and the
  MATLAB bundle.

Release rejection
-----------------

- Delete the tags from the snoopycrimecop remotes.
- Delete the directories containing the landing pages and artifacts.

Release acceptance
------------------

- Push the tags from the snoopycrimecop remotes to origin. The tags should now
  be visible in the GitHub interface (see for instance
  https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy/tree/v.4.4.9).

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Update the version numbers set in the :envvar:`OMERO_RELEASE` and
  :envvar:`BF_RELEASE` variables of the documentation release jobs.
- Build and promote :jenkinsjob:`OMERO-4.4-release-docs` and
  :jenkinsjob:`BIOFORMATS-4.4-release-docs` or
  :jenkinsjob:`OMERO-5.0-release-docs` and
  :jenkinsjob:`BIOFORMATS-5.0-release-docs` or
  :jenkinsjob:`OMERO-5.1-release-docs` and
  :jenkinsjob:`BIOFORMATS-5.1-release-docs`.
- Check that the OMERO and Bio-Formats documentations sets are correctly
  deployed, both HTML and PDF.
- Update the staging user help site with new screenshots, new version numbers,
  and previous version archive and deploy the user help website using
  :jenkinsjob:`HELP-release-docs`.

Public release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Move the announcement post to the public Announcements forum.
- Re-run the download page generation job for both Bio-Formats and OMERO. In
  the window that opens after clicking on :guilabel:`Build with Parameters` in
  the :jenkinsjob:`OMERO-4.4-release-downloads`,  
  :jenkinsjob:`OMERO-5.0-release-downloads` or
  :jenkinsjob:`OMERO-5.1-release-downloads` job, set the
  :envvar:`ANNOUNCEMENT_URL` variable to the value of the URL of the public
  post.
- Check the link to the announcement and the URL of the tags have been updated
  in the OMERO and Bio-Formats downloads pages.
- Remove the :file:`.htaccess` file from the release folders and make the
  release folders read-only::

    hudson@necromancer /ome/data_repo/public/omero $ rm $RELEASE/.htaccess
    hudson@necromancer /ome/data_repo/public/omero $ chmod -R a-w $RELEASE
    hudson@necromancer /ome/data_repo/public/bio-formats $ rm $RELEASE/.htaccess
    hudson@necromancer /ome/data_repo/public/bio-formats $ chmod -R a-w $RELEASE
- Set up the apache redirects for the latest version of manuals.
- Update version number for Upgrade check. This is currently done
  by connecting to the “feedback” database on necromancer.

  .. parsed-literal::
     select * from registry_version;
     update registry_version set version = '\ |release|';
- Announce the release on the mailing lists and Twitter, and in News.
- Update openmicroscopy.org home page with latest release number, date and
  Milestone page link.
- Update the OMERO version history plone page.
- Add the OMERO version release date to the Web Stats Spreadsheet

Post release
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. |releasetag| replace:: v.\ |release|

-  Close the Trac and GitHub milestones.
-  Change the reports in the left-hand column of trac.
-  Upgrade any deployed servers (KIT, Warlock, Nightshade...).

   -  Schedule Nightshade downtime.
   -  Perform the server upgrade.
-  Update online validator (See :ticket:`8640` for an example).
-  Assign the adequate milestone to closed PRs on Github using
   ``scc check-milestone`` with the :option:`--set` option::

      scc check-milestone 5.0.0-alpha2 5.0.0-alpha3 --set 5.0.0-alpha3

-  Add the released version on the right panel of
   http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/admin/ticket/versions.
-  Open a PR to bump the Homebrew formulas of OMERO and Bio-Formats.
-  Merge the release tag into the `master` branch and push to `origin`.

Demo server
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Ask KIT administrators whether they are willing to upgrade.
-  Make sure the users are informed about the upgrade of KIT when it happens.
-  Submit any necessary configuration options while upgrading.
-  Test demo server.
-  Email announcement.

Additional plone updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- If any changes have been made to documentation URLs, ensure links in plone 
  Product pages (e.g. OMERO Feature List) and documentation index are updated.

Major releases
--------------

-  If major release, rename ``*-trunk`` jenkins jobs to ``*-<RELEASE_NAME>``
-  Add bioformats branches to :file:`/hudson/bioformats.git/git-fetch.sh` and
   :file:`hooks/post-receive`
