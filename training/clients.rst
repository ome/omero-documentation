.. topic:: Overview

    OMERO has two main client options for managing and accessing remotely 
    any data that you have stored on an installation of the OMERO server: 
    a web application OMERO.web and a downloadable desktop application OMERO.insight.  
    Both clients enable you to visualize and interact with multi-dimensional image data.
    You can search, tag, annotate and generally organize your data, perform a variety of 
    analyses directly and/or launch analysis scripts running server side.
