Managing Your Data
==================

Overview
========
   This page describes the OMERO.insight Client Data Manager.



The Data Manager
----------------
The OMERO.insight default view is made up of three sections: the Inspector Panel, the Working Area Panel and the Metadata Browser Panel.

The Inspector Panel
-------------------
Navigating and Managing the Hierarchies
The standardised  view of the image data is in the Project, Dataset, Image hierarchy. Expanding the navigation tree allows you to see this structure. 


To create a new Project or Dataset select the icon and name the new Project or Dataset.

The Inspector Panel - Screens   
-----------------------------
This will bring you a tree view to browse high content screening data in a hierarchy of screens and wells. Double clicking on the image will present the grid view of the wells, where individual images for the wells can be accessed.

Tags   
----
This panel allows you to view all the tags that you have created and used in OMERO.  
A tag can belong to a parent object called a tag set. For example a typical arrangement can be:

..Comment(screenshot 5: a list of tags in a tag set with images shown in central panel).


Images
------
This panel keeps a history of your imported images. It is possible to retrieve images based on the date that they where imported in the OMERO system.

..[NOTE: There is currently no Screenshot as I am unsure if this is a piece of functionality that we wish to promote given that is is scheduled to be updated.].


Search  
------
This panel allows you to search on the images within the OMERO system. The search term is entered in the field shown in highlighted area 1. The search field also supports multiple and single character wild card searching.
The search context allows you to search on the range of Name, Comments, URL, Description, Tags, and Attachments. This is displayed in the spotlighted area 2. The results of the search are presented in the central working area panel. Additional information about the results is shown in the highlighted area 3.

settings for one image can be applied to all other images in the dataset by using the option apply to all.
