To import images with the OMERO.insight importer, the import process follows three steps of The File Selection, Location selection and Import.


The File & Location Selection 
-----------------------------
Use the File Chooser to browse and select the images.

Select the file(s) to import by pressing the right arrow icon when clicked on the location Selection window pops up as shown below. OMERO uses a Project/Dataset hierarchy structure and so a new Project/Dataset can be created for each import or if available an existing Project/Dataset can be selected.
