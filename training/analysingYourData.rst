To create an ROI you can use the toolbar shown below to select what type of ROI is to be created.

To create an ROI, first click on the ROI type you wish to create, then click on the image viewer and drag the shape to the desired size.
Once a ROI is created it can be manipulated by first clicking on the arrow icon. Depending on the shape it can be moved, resized or rotated. Double clicking on a line will split it into two segments creating a polyline, this can be repeated to create as many segments as needed. The nodes on the line can be moved around to the required shape. Double clicking inside a shape will allow you to enter a text label.


ROI Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^
Once ROIs are created, these appear in the ROI manager tab. The ROI manager tab is the default view of the ROI tool. Using the manager tab it is possible to select the individual ROIs. The visibility check box also allows you to toggle the visibility of the ROI in the image viewer.
