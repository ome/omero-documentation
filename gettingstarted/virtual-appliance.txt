Virtual Appliance
=================

The OMERO virtual appliance is a quick, easy, & low-cost way to try
out OMERO.server on your laptop or desktop. This enables you to make
an informed decision about whether committing to an OMERO.server
install is right for you.

Virtualisation enables canned, ready to run software environments to be
created and used, in the form of Virtual Machines (VM), or to be
distributed for others to use, in the form of Virtual Appliances. A
Virtual Appliance is essentially a file that describes how to create a
new Virtual Machine on demand. The virtualised software environment can
contain an entire operating system (OS), such as Windows or Linux, and
any other software that runs in that OS, such as, in this case,
OMERO.server and its associated software prerequisites. Once created and
started, you can log into the OS and use it as though it were a real
machine. One way to think of this is as though you had an entire
computer in a window on your desktop.

When using virtualisation software, the OS that is running the
virtualisation software is referred to as the "**host OS**\ ". When you
use virtualisation, the OS running within a virtual machine is referred
to as the "**guest OS**\ ". This allows us to be explicit about which OS
we are working in.

Effectively this means that the OME Project can distribute a canned,
ready-to-run environment containing an OMERO.server, thus freeing you
from having to install OMERO.server yourself, and letting you
concentrate on evaluating the functionality of the OMERO.server and its
clients.

.. note:: 
    The virtual hard-drive used by the OMERO virtual appliance is
    30GB in size and you should probably keep track of the amount of this
    space that you have consumed and, if necessary, delete data that is not
    required. If your data is likely to exceed this space whilst you are
    evaluating OMERO then it is worthwhile going through the 
    :ref:`gettingstarted/virtualappliance#increasing-hd-size` before you start working with
    OMERO in earnest.

Getting Started
---------------

To use the virtual appliance you should do the following:

-  Install VirtualBox
-  Download the OMERO.server virtual appliance
-  Import the virtual appliance into Virtual Box to create a virtual
   machine
-  Start the virtual machine

Each of these points is outlined in more detail in the remainder of this
page...

Install VirtualBox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to use the OMERO.server virtual appliance you need to install
VirtualBox. Download VirtualBox from the
`Downloads page <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_ and follow the
installation process for your platform. If in doubt you should download,
or upgrade to, the latest version of VirtualBox. Once VirtualBox is
installed run the application. Depending upon your platform & version,
the VirtualBox interface should look similar to the following
screenshot:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-1vboxinstall.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Download the OMERO.server Virtual Appliance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The virtual appliance can be downloaded from :jenkins:`here
<job/OMERO-trunk-virtualbox/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/src/docs/install/VM/omero-vm-latest-build.ova>`,
and should have a filename similar to, e.g. omero-vm.ova

Import OMERO Virtual Appliance into VirtualBox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Start VirtualBox then select **'File/Import Appliance'**. You will be
   presented with a dialogue box.
-  Select choose then navigate to the location where you downloaded the
   the virtual appliance file.
-  Select your OVA file then click **open**.

This process is indicated in the following screenshot:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-2import-selection.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt: 

-  Click **continue**. You will be presented with a range of options for
   the VM that will be built from the appliance.

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-3import-settings.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt: 

-  You can accept the defaults by clicking **Done**.

You should now see a progress bar as your new virtual machine is built
from the appliance. This import process can take a few minutes depending
upon your hardware. Feel free to make a coffee whilst you are waiting ;)

When the import procedure is complete your new VM should appear in the
VirtualBox VM library ready for use.

Networking
^^^^^^^^^^

Our virtual appliance is distributed with VirtualBox's built in
Host-Only Network Address Translation (NAT) preconfigured. This means
that the IP address for the VM is 10.0.2.15 which is the default
VirtualBox Host-Only NAT address. Using this address is the simplest way
to distribute a virtual appliance when you do not know the setup of a
user's network.

.. _virtualappliance_portforwarding:

Port-Forwarding Settings
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Your host OS cannot connect directly to 10.0.2.15 but needs to use
port-forwarding. This means that you connect to your localhost on a
specific port and the communications to and from that port are forwarded
to specified ports on the guest VM.

Our virtual appliance should be preconfigured with the correct
port-forwarding setting configured during the import process. However,
it is best to double check that these settings are correctly set up:

-  Select your VM in the VirtualBox VM Library
-  Click on **Settings** then select the **Network** tab
-  Click on **Advanced**
-  Click on **Port Forwarding**

If the table in the window that appears is empty then port forwarding is
not setup. The required port-forwarding settings are as follows:

=========== ======== ========= ========= ========= ==========
Name        Protocol Host IP   Host Port Guest IP  Guest Port
=========== ======== ========= ========= ========= ==========
omero-ssl   TCP      127.0.0.1 4064      10.0.2.15  4064
omero-unsec TCP      127.0.0.1 4063      10.0.2.15  4063
omero-web   TCP      127.0.0.1 8080      10.0.2.15  4080
ssh         TCP      127.0.0.1 2222      10.0.2.15  22
=========== ======== ========= ========= ========= ==========

When correctly setup in VirtualBox your port forwarding settings should
look like this:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-4portforwarding.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt: 

If you are on Linux or Mac OS X then you can either use our port
forwarding setup script or else you can set up port forwarding settings
manually. 

On Microsoft Windows systems you will have to set up port
forwarding manually as the script requires a bash shell. The script can
be downloaded from here and is run by opening a shell and executing the
following command:

::

       $ bash setup_port_forwarding.sh $VMNAME

where $VMNAME is the name of your VM. 

.. note:: By default the scripts create a VM named **omerovm** and the 
	pre-built appliance is named **omero-vm**

Adding port forwarding manually is achieved by editing the port
forwarding table that we displayed before. Use the **+** to add a new
row to the table then clicking in each cell and typing in the required
settings.

Now we are ready to start our VM. Select the VM in the VirtualBox VM
library then click **start**.

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-5library.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt: 


A window should open containing a console for your VM which should now
be going through it's standard boot process. OMERO.server is
automatically started at boot time which means that you should be able
to interact with OMERO without further setup.

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-6boot.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a number of accounts that are preconfigured in the OMERO
virtual appliance. Two of these are OS accounts, for logging into the VM
as either the **root** user or the **omero** user. There is also a
single OMERO.server account which is used to access the OMERO.server
software as the OMERO.server **root** user

Virtual Appliance OS Credentials
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

======== =========
Username Password
======== =========
root     swordfish
omero      omero
======== =========

OMERO.server Credentials
""""""""""""""""""""""""

======== ========
Username Password
======== ========
root     omero
======== ========

You can use this administrative account to create as many user level
accounts as you require in the usual way.

Working with the OMERO.VM
-------------------------

Now that your VM is up and running you have a choice about how to
interact with it.

-  You can connect to OMERO.web from your host browser. Go to
   http://localhost:8080/webclient.
-  You can **use OMERO.clients from within your host OS.** This will
   allow you to import data via a GUI and manage that data once
   imported. To do so, download the :plone:`insight client <support/omero4/downloads>`
   and follow the instructions below. More information can be found
   under the :ref:`tutorial/insight-getting-started` section
   which details how to use the OMERO.clients.
-  Alternatively, you can interact with the server command line
   interface by SSH'ing into the guest VM or by opening a console within
   the VM itself. Administrators may need to use one of these methods to
   restart the server and/or change configuration parameters. In this
   case you must have an SSH client installed on your host machine that
   you will then use to connect to the OMERO.server.

.. note:: The following example assume that the OMERO VM is up & running on the same machine that you are working on.

OMERO.web
^^^^^^^^^

Go directly to http://localhost:8080/webclient to log in with user:
"root" / pw: "omero".

.. note::
    If you receive a 502 nginx error on first attempting to
    connect to the web app on http://localhost:8080/webclient/ please
    try restarting the virtual machine and try again.

OMERO.insight
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run regular OMERO clients on your host machine and connect to
the server in the VM. Our example uses OMERO.insight running on Mac OS X
to connect to the VM.

-  `Download <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/downloads>`_
   & :ref:`install <tutorial/insight-getting-started>` OMERO.insight
-  Start OMERO.insight
-  Click the spanner icon situated above the password box so that we can
   enter the server settings box which looks like this:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-7server-addresses.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

-  Use the *+* icon to add a new server entry with the address
   *localhost* and the port *4064* then click apply
-  You can now use the login credentials given above to log into insight
   using the following window (user: "root" / pw: "omero"):

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-8login.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

-  Insight should now load up & look like so:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-9insight.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

You can now use insight to import & manage images on a locally running
virtual server just like you could using a remote server.

Secure Shell
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can log into your VM using Secure Shell (SSH) which will give you a
command line interface to the VM from where you can use the |OmeroCli|. In
the following example, we assume that you have an SSH client installed
on your host machine and also that your VM is up and running.

You can log into the VM using the above credentials and the following
command typed into a terminal:

::

    $ ssh omero@localhost -p 2222

This invokes the SSH program telling it to login to the localhost on
port 2222 using the username *omero*. Remember that earlier we set up
port forwarding to forward port 2222 on the host machine to port 22 (the
default SSH port) on the guest VM. If all goes well you will be prompted
for a password. Once you have successfully entered your password you
should be greeted by a prompt similar to the following:

::

    omero@omerovm:~$

There are two potential complications to this method, (1) if you have
used a VM before then there could be old SSH fingerprints set up, (2)
the first time that you log into the VM you will be asked to confirm
that wish to continue connecting. If you get the following message after
you invoke ssh:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-cli-fingerprint-warning.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 


then you can remove the old fingerprints with the following command
typed into the terminal:

::

    $ ssh-keygen -R [localhost]:2222 -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts

as illustrated in this screenshot:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-cli-fingerprint-remove-old.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

The first time that you log into the VM you will also be asked to
confirm that you wish to connect to this machine by a message similar to
the following:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-cli-fingerprint.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

You should confirm that you wish to continue connecting, after which you
will be prompted for your password as usual:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-cli-password-prompt.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

After which, if all has gone well, you should have a prompt indicating
that you have a shell open and logged into the VM:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-cli-afterlogin.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Log into the VM directly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    Due to the frequent changes in the VirtualBox Guest
    Additions, key mappings between the host and guest OS do not always
    work. We recommend using SSH as the primary way of interacting with
    the Virtual Appliance CLI.

When you start your VM using the Virtual Box GUI, as outlined above, a
window will be displayed showing the boot process for the machine as it
starts up, just like with a real piece of hardware. Once the boot
process has finished you will see a prompt displayed in this window like
so:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-cli-login.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

you can log into the console of the VM directly using the user account
credentials above.

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-cli-password.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

There is no GUI on the current OMERO virtual appliance so you will have
to be happy using the Bash shell which looks like this:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-cli-vmconsole.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

From here you can interact with OMERO.server via the |OmeroCli|. You
will need to login as the 'omero' user to access the OMERO CLI (user:
"omero" / pw: "omero"). Logout using Ctrl-D.

Known Issues
------------

Networking Not Working
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occasionally, during the boot process, the VirtualBox DHCP server fails
to allocate an IP address to the OS in the guest VM. This means that
OMERO.clients, such as OMERO.Insight, cannot connect to the OMERO.server
in the VM.

-  \*\* CAUSE: \*\* We believe that this is an intermittent VirtualBox
   bug that resurfaces across many versions `VirtualBox
   #4038 <https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/4038>`_ & previously
   `VirtualBox #3655 <https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/3655>`_

-  \*\* DIAGNOSIS: \*\* Check whether the guest VM has been allocated
   the reserved host-only NAT IP address. If 10.0.2.15 does not appear
   in the output from ifconfig then this issue has occurred. The easiest
   way to verify this is to log into the guest VM console and check the
   output from executing the following command:

   ::

       $ ifconfig

-  \*\* SOLUTION: \*\* An easy, but unreliable, fix is to reboot the
   guest VM. The preferred fix is to log into the guest VM console and
   execute the following commands which will cause the guest OS to
   release it's IP lease before requesting a new lease:

   ::

       $ dhclient -r
       $ dhclient -eth0

Port conflict when OMERO.server already running in Host OS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are already running an instance of the OMERO.server in your host
OS then there will be a conflict due to the ports assigned to VirtualBox
port-forwarding being the same as those already in use by the
OMERO.server in the host OS.

-  \*\* SOLUTION 1: \*\* Turn off the OMERO.server in the host
   environment by issuing the following command:

   ::

       $ omero admin stop

-  \*\* SOLUTION 2: \*\* Alter the port-forwarding settings for your
   OMERO.VM as described in the :ref:`virtualappliance_portforwarding`
   section. For example, increment the host port settings for omero-ssl,
   omero-unsec, and omero-web. 

   .. note:: 

	   We are assuming that your host OS is
	   not already running services on those ports. You can check whether
	   something is already listening on any of these ports by running the
	   following commands (Mac OS X) which should return the prompt without
	   any further output if there is nothing listening:

	   ::

	       $ lsof -nP | grep -E '(:4063)|(:4064)'

VM won't boot because the HDD is full
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you manage to fill the virtual HDD used by your VM then you will
likely discover that the OS is unable to boot and you cannot therefore
get access to your OMERO.server install. If this occurs you may also get
a "errno 28: no space left on device" message. To log into your VM you
will need to use the recovery mode. Start the VM and at the Grub screen,
use the down arrow followed by return to select the following entry:

::

        Ubuntu, with Linux 3.0.0-12-generic (recovery mode)

as seen in this screenshot:

.. figure:: ../images/virtual-appliance-cli-recovery-console.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 


Don't worry if your VM has a kernel number different to
3.0.0-12-generic, the important thing is that you select the entry
labelled recovery mode. At this point the VM should rapidly boot into
the recovery mode which will enable you to log in using the root
password *swordfish*.

Once you have logged in you have a number of things that you can do but
the recommended courses of action are either:

1. Delete unneeded files using standard Linux command line tools like
   *rm* to make space for the VM to boot normally then use your favoured
   OMERO client to login and delete more files. A useful place to start
   might be by deleting the logs stored in /var/logs.
2. Increase the size of your virtual HDD. If you have filled your
   existing HDD then it is likely that the volume of data that you are
   storing in the OMERO VM is too big for the default HDD. You should
   follow the instructions on the :ref:`gettingstarted/virtualappliance#increasing-hd-size`
   page to ensure that the size of
   virtual HDD you have available is commensurate with the volumes of
   data that you are collecting.

.. _gettingstarted/virtualappliance#increasing-hd-size:

Increasing HD Size 
------------------

Image data can become very large
and can easily fill available hard-drive space. The OMERO virtual
appliance (VA) is similar to a non-virtualised installation in that the
amount of disk space available is limited. By default, the OMERO virtual
appliance is supplied with a 30GB virtual hard-drive. Before using the
appliance you should consider the volume of data that you will need to
work with whist evaluating OMERO and whether you should increase the
size of the virtual hard-drive to suit your needs. The remainder of this
page is a step-by-step guide that demonstrates how to increase your
virtual hard-drive.

Please bear in mind that this is not a risk-free procedure and that you
should ensure that you have a backup of your Virtual Machine (VM) before
proceeding.

Preliminary Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download an Ubuntu Linux ISO
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Download an `Ubuntu Linux
iso <http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop>`_. The default,
currently Ubuntu 11.10 32bit, is fine. We will need this later in the
process.  

Backup your VM
"""""""""""""" 

Before we do anything else we should
create a clone of the omero-vm and subsequently work on the copy. This
way if something gets broken we can always start again. The easiest way
to do this is from the command line. 

.. note:: 

	If you are on Windows then you should navigate to `C:\\Program Files\\
	Oracle\\VirtualBox\\` because the VBoxManage tools are not added to your path by default. 

So, start a
shell and, assuming that your VM has the default name of omero-vm, use
the following command:

::

      $ VBoxManage clonevm omero-vm --mode machine --options keepallmacs --name omero-vm-2 --register

This will create a copy of our VM called omero-vm-2 which we will make
alterations to. This means that we can always return to the original
omero-vm if we break anything. From now on **ONLY** make changes to
omero-vm-2

Extending the HDD
"""""""""""""""""

By default our virtual hard drive attached to omero-vm-2 is of a type
which cannot be extended; so we need to change this by cloning our HDD
from the VDMK type to VDI type:

::

      $ VBoxManage clonehd omero-vm-2-disk1.vmdk omero-vm-2-disk1.vdi --format VDI

We now need to increase the size of our virtual HDD. In the following
command I am resizing the HDD to 60GB but you should select a size to
suit the amount of data you plan to store in OMERO:

::

      $ VBoxManage modifyhd omero-vm-2-disk1.vdi --resize 60000

We now need to tell VirtualBox to use omero-vm-2-disk1.vdi instead of
omero-vm-2-disk1.vmdk which is currently attached to the VM. Start
VirtualBox and select omero-vm-2 in the VM library.

Click settings then select the storage tab.

Right-click on omero-vm-2-disk1.vmdk and select remove attachment. Next
to the SATA CONTROLLER entry click the right hand plus icon & in the
pop-up dialog "Choose existing disk". Now navigate to the location where
VirtualBox stores your virtual machines and enter the omero-vm-2
directory. Select the omero-vm-2 disk1.vdi and click open.

Whilst we are on the storage tab we can attach the Ubuntu iso that we
downloaded earlier to our VM. We are going to temporarily use the Ubuntu
iso to boot the VM so that we can use some of the tools in the Ubuntu
iso to make changes to the filesystem within our VM. Add an IDE
Controller using the "Add Controller" icon . Select this new controller
then click 'Add CD/DVD device' then 'Choose Disk'. Navigate to the
location of your Ubuntu iso, select it and click OK.

The storage for your OMERO VM should now look similar to the following:

Click OK to return to the VirtualBox VM library. With omero-vm-2
selected ensure that the storage details match what you expect, e.g.
omero-vm-2-disk1.vdi is connected to youSATA Port 0. The size for this
disk should also more or less match what you specified earlier with the
'VBoxManage modifyhd' command. Don't worry if the numbers do not exactly
matchup, for example, I specified a virtualised HDD of 60GB and the
reported size is 58.59GB.

Start the omero-vm-2 VM. Ubuntu linux should boot and you should
eventually see a Welcome screen giving you the option to try or install
Ubuntu.

Select try Ubuntu and you should be presented with a graphical desktop.

Start the gparted tool using the menu option under :menuselection:`System --> Administration --> GParted Partition Editor`.

The GParted GUI will display:

Right-click the entry for /dev/sda5 and select Swapoff.

Now right click on /dev/sda5 and click Delete to remove the swap
partition.

Delete /dev/sda2 in the same way. This should leave us with two entries,
one for /dev/sda1 and one for unallocated space.

We now need to resize our /dev/sda1 partition. Right-click /dev/sda1 and
select resize. Now drag the right arrow to the right until the entry for
'Free space following (MiB)' is about 2000 then click 'Resize/Move'.

Right click the entry for unallocated space and select 'New' from the
pop-up menu. Select 'linux-swap' from the 'File system' drop-down menu
then 'Add'.

Up until this point we haven't actually applied any of our changes to
the hdd, we have only specified a list of changes that should be made.
We can now go ahead and apply them by selecting the :menuselection:`Edit --> Apply All
Operations` menu item then clicking 'Apply' in the confirmation dialog
box.

When the operations have completed dismiss the dialog with the 'Close'
button, close GParted, then shutdown the VM.

We no longer need the Ubuntu ISO so we can detach it from our VM. Ensure
that omero-vm-2 is selected then click 'Settings' and select the
'Storage' tab. Right-click the IDE Controller entry and select 'Remove
Controller' then click 'OK' to return the VirtualBox VM library.

Start the omero-vm-2 VM and allow it to boot. Log in as root then issue
the df -h command. Verify that the size of the /dev/sda1 is
approximately what you expect, e.g. if you allocated a 60GB virtual HDD
then after size conversions and swap allocation we should end up with
/dev/sda1 reported as being around 56GB.

Now, within the VM we need to add the UUID of the new swap partition to
the /etc/fstab file because we deleted the old one & created a new swap
which means that the IDs will no longer match.

::

      $ vim /etc/fstab

Move your cursor to the entry that looks similar to the following:

::

      UUID=SOME-LONG-ALPHA-NUMERIC-STRING none swap sw 0 0

then press i to entry "insert mode". Now delete the alphanumeric string
so that the entry looks similar to the following:

::

      UUID= none swap sw 0 0

and place your cursor after the equals sign. We will now issue a command
from within the VIM editor to insert our new swap UUID into the fstab
file.

::

      [Insert Mode] <CTRL-R> =system('/sbin/blkid -t TYPE=swap | cut -c18-53') <return>

Save your file and quit VIM

::

      [Command Mode] :wq <return>

Now reboot your VM with: $ shutdown -r now

Once your VM has rebooted you should now have a working VM with a larger
virtual HDD.
