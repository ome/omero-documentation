Handling Import Errors
======================

Although the OMERO.importer supports a large number of file formats,
sometimes errors will occur in the import process. When this happens,
OMERO.importer will generally present you with an error dialog and to
alert you of the problem.

Examining Your Errors
---------------------

When an error does occur, you can usually get a technical overview of
the problem by examining the Debug Text Tab. This may give you hints as
to why your import failed, which can often be attributed to misplaced or
renamed files, corrupted images, unsupported formats, or other easily
fixed problems. For even more technical information you can also examine
the importer's log file by choosing the "Show log file location" option
under the "Help" menu. Opening this log file in a text editor will show
you all the technical information collected during your import.

The Import Errors Tab
---------------------

In cases where a file has failed to import, the error message generated
is also added to the Error Message Queue, which can be found by clicking
on the Import Errors Tab. From this tab, you can review all the import
errors collected during the import session, as well as select which
image files you wish to send us by using the check-box beside each
error.

Submitting Errors
-----------------

You can submit your errors to us using the "Send Feedback" button at the
bottom of the Import Errors Tab, which will display a feedback dialog so
you can include an optional message and email address. The bottom of
this dialog also gives you a chance to opt out of sending us your images
and log file should you so desire, however providing us with this
information will allow us to more accurately duplicate and fix your
problem, thereby improving the reliability of our software as a whole.
