Importing Images in Insight
===========================

For more information on the file formats currently supported in OMERO see
:bioformats:`File Formats <>`.

In order to begin the import of images into an OMERO server, you need to:

-  Click the OMERO.insight importer icon.

.. figure:: /images/insight-import-1icon.png

-  You will be presented with the OMERO.insight Importer Window

.. figure:: /images/insight-import-2clientimporter.png
   :align: center
   :alt: OMERO.insight importer window

To import images with the OMERO.insight importer, the import process
follows three steps:

Step 1: File Selection
----------------------

-  Use the File Chooser panel to browse and select the images.

.. figure:: /images/insight-import-3filechooser.png
   :align: center
   :alt: OMERO.insight file chooser

- Add the selected images to the Files to Import by pressing the |right| icon.
- Single Image files can be removed from Files to Import using the |left| icon.
- Alternatively the |doubleleft| button can be used to remove all the
  image files from the import queue.

Step 2: Location selection
--------------------------

- On the selection of the file(s) to import by pressing the |right|
  icon the Location Selection window pops up.

- It is at this point of the process that the destination of the
  import is determined.

- OMERO uses a Project/Dataset hierarchy structure and so a new
  Project/Dataset can be created for each import or if available an
  existing Project/Dataset can be selected.

Existing Project Selection.

.. figure:: /images/insight-import-5project.png
   :align: center
   :alt: OMERO.insight project selection

Once the specific Project has been chosen the existing Dataset's
available are shown under the chosen Project.

.. figure:: /images/insight-import-6dataset.png
   :align: center
   :alt: OMERO.insight dataset selection

Alternatively a new Project and/or Dataset can be created

.. figure:: /images/insight-import-7newproject.png
   :align: center
   :alt: OMERO.insight new project

Once the Project/Dataset has been created the selected images will
reside in the import queue panel with the details of the files/folder
the size of the file and its location within the chosen Project/Dataset.

New From Folder Import
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The client importer also supports the ability for the chosen Dataset to
reflect the chosen folder name. This is demonstrated in the case below
where the folder 27-06-11 has been selected with the option --New From
Folder-- in the Dataset selection.

.. figure:: /images/insight-import-9newdataset.png

With this selection made when added to the import queue the Dataset
created now takes on the folder name. In this screenshot below, the
Dataset name is pngstack. The confirmation of this action is displayed
in the import queue panel with the information shown in the
Project/Dataset and the information set in the tick box for folder as
Dataset.

Step 3: Import
--------------

When ready the image files can now be imported by clicking the import
button.

.. figure:: /images/insight-import-11startimport.png

On import, the Import tab will open as displayed below. The following
information is presented in the Import tab:

- the number of files/folders imported

- when the import started and the duration of the import

.. figure:: /images/insight-import-12importprogress.png

On completion of the import, an hyperlink indicating the location of the
import is displayed allowing users to browse the dataset.

The import tab also displays the image thumbnail, double-clicking on it
launches the Image Viewer. If no thumbnail displayed, a View Button will
be available, just click to launch the viewer.

Options
-------

File Naming
^^^^^^^^^^^

- Select or Add a project and dataset where to import the images.
- The File Naming section allows to select the name of the imported
  images
- Partial Version + Files Name - This is a short version
  e.g. myImage.tiff
- Full Path + Files Name = This is a full version e.g.
  ``C:\\ScientificImages\\Images\\myImage.tiff``
- Directories before a file - This is a customised version i.e. the
  short version plus a number of leading directories
  e.g. ``Images/myImage.tiff``
- Click on Import to Add to Queue button.

Tagging on Import
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OMERO.insight supports Tagging on Import. This feature can be found
through
the options setting.

Once the tags have been added they may be viewed to from the list.

.. figure:: /images/insight-import-18viewtags.png
   :align: center
   :alt: OMERO.insight view tags

On the completion of import, the tags will then be shown under the
annotations panel in the Right-hand panel in the Data Manager.

Toggle between Single Image Formats versus Screening Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The client also now supports toggling between single - or
  project-based images that typically go into 'datasets' or
  screen-based image sets that typically go into 'screens'.
- To toggle between these two views in the importer clicking on the
  Location icon will switch the view.
